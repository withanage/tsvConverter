,1 Aspekte gemeinsamer Agrarpolitik 2000,en_US,"Agricultural Markets at the Turn of 2000/2001 (1) EU agricultural policy discussion focussed on two issues in 2000: EU enlargement and WTO negotiations. The approaching - yet unknown - date of Eastern enlargement is alerting EU farmers who fear growing competition to endanger their protected markets. Those fears are, however, countered by hinting to both, the impediments on the path of East European producers struggling for higher efficiency and the chances offering themselves to West European entrepreneurs on enlarged markets. Ongoing preparations for another round of agricultural trade negotiations give rise to highlight the weaknesses of the UR Agreement on Agriculture. Thereafter the positions of WTO member groupings are contrasted for better understanding the difficulties which the negotiations are likely to run into later this year.",,,,,2001-01-01,50,1,2001,,Articles,ART,,1,Dirk,Manegold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"2 Die Märkte für Getreide, Ölsaaten und Kartoffeln",en_US,"(2) World cereals production in 2000 fell short of the 1999 harvest and most exporting countries ran down stocks. Nevertheless, key world grain prices kept on falling. More and more, genetically modified organisms become an issue to international trade in cereals and oilseeds since importing countries are getting concerned about potential health or environmental risks. In spite of periodically or regionally adverse weather conditions the cereals harvest of EU member countries finally turned out to be the biggest ever - almost 24 mt above domestic use. Due to the price reduction through CAP reform (Agenda 2000), the weak Euro, and less ample supplies in several exporting or importing countries EU producers expected improved export conditions. At the same time, however, EU imports started to increase for matching particular quality requirements of the domestic processing industry.",,,,,2001-01-01,50,1,2001,,Articles,ART,,2,Friedrich,Uhlmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,3 Der Markt für Zucker,en_US,(3) The world sugar market remained well supplied in 2000 although there was a short lived speculation for higher prices released by exaggerated reports about eventual crop shortfalls. Low world prices required the EU Commission to make fine-tuned cuts into national sugar quotas for exactly complying with WTO export restric-tions. The Council of Farm Ministers agreed to roll on the Common Market Organization without making deci-sive changes while medium term prospects signal world supplies to further outpace demand.,,,,,2001-01-01,50,1,2001,,Articles,ART,,3,Ulrich,Sommer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,4 Der Markt für Milch,en_US,"(4) Driven by demand expansion and favourable prices world dairy production continued to rise and international trade in milk products slowly recovered from the consequences of the various economic crises in 1998-99. Assuming continued economic growth, demand and prices are likely to increase. Extremely low stocks and scarce market supplies of skimmed milk powder in the EU caused the Commission to reduce the level of subsidies spent on milk powder for calf raising. Butter stocks, however, remained high and EU exports failed to improve due to sluggish demand. Export subsidies on cheese were repeatedly reduced reflecting both firm demand and the weak Euro. With regard to milk production quotas, several EU member countries made special arrangements for allotting parts of the additional quotas to their producers while others introduced some kind of regulated quota exchange. The latter is expected not only to better bring together quota demand and supply but also to avoid transactions at extremely high prices.",,,,,2001-01-01,50,1,2001,,Articles,ART,,4,Petra,Salamon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,5 Die Märkte für Schlachtvieh und Fleisch,en_US,"(5) Based on estimated head numbers world bovine meat production is expected to show a slight dent in 2001 but any prognosis of developments in the world beef market crucially depends on the outcome of regional difficulties as e.g. animal diseases or economic crises. Following the detection of growing numbers of BSE-infected animals in several continental member states the EU beef and cattle markets are at present badly affected by a new scare. Prices reflect a steep fall of consumer confidence and governments hastened to demonstrate activities in trying to eradicate the dangerous disease. Meat and bone meals were totally banned from animal feeding rations and destruction of some two million untested carcasses is envisaged. World pig meat production is on the whole rising while EU production may show a 1 % reduction.

,Market power of selected German food and beverage exporters on international markets,en_US,"In this paper we applied two well known empirical models, the 'pricing-to-market' and the 'residual demand elasticity' approach, to test for market power of German food and beverage exporters on the main international markets (beer, cocoa powder, chocolate, and sugar confectionary). We compared the estimation results and considered the time series properties of the model variables, which both had an impact on the conclusions drawn from the model estimates.On many international food markets conditions for the existence of market power are fulfilled, such as concentrated supply and/or demand structures, or specific product qualities. For the products under study we have shown that the supply side is highly concentrated. For instance, for beer, cocoa powder, chocolate, and sugar confectionary the six biggest importers hold a significant share of total imports of the respective destinations. In addition, many products are well known for their specific quality characteristics.The 'pricing-to-market' model identifies market power by the estimation of the exchange rate transmission elasticity. A significant transmission elasticity above minus one indicates the use of market power. The 'residual demand elasticity' approach signalizes market power if the estimates for the elasticity lie in the range of minus one to less than infinity. Both frameworks utilize the effects of exchange rate variations on export volumes and prices.On four markets, US and Canadian beer market, UK sugar confectionary, and Italian cocoa powder market, we find significant parameters for the exchange rate transmission elasticity which indicate a 'pricing to market' behavior with similar estimates around -0.7. Thus, the use of market power by German exporters cannot be rejected for these products and destinations. Because the RDE model results do not indicate market power at all, both approaches partly result inconsistent conclusions, which further do not fit to the fact that the law of one price is significantly violated for all products. Even though markets obviously indicate to some extent market power, the applied model approaches do not consistently detect it. Therefore, the observed price discrimination must be caused by some other factors than the deviation of demand elasticities between international markets. The explicit consideration of competitors' behaviour on the international markets can be one factor that might be worthwhile to enhance the understanding of the pricing process on these markets.",,,,,2001-03-01,50,2,2001,,Articles,ART,,2,Thomas,Glauben,Jens-Peter,Loy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Estimating expenditure and price elasticities of food commodities using German cross-sectional household data,en_US,"This study presents a procedure to estimate expenditure and price elasticities of food commodities from cross-sectional data. There are two problems with the use of cross-sectional data: First, price-information is not sufficient in these data. To derive ""adjusted prices"" from cross-sectional data an approach of COX and WOHLGENANT is applied. Second, zero expenditures for some commodity groups can be observed. To avoid selectivity bias a generalization of the HECKMAN procedure is employed. Both, the adjusted prices and the bias correction are included in a Linear Expenditure System. It can be concluded that expenditure and price elasticities could differ significantly between household characteristics. The research results suggest that attempts to use only the mean elasticity coefficient as a description of consumer behaviour without regarding the variances between households might be not appropriate.",,,,,2001-03-01,50,2,2001,,Articles,ART,,3,Silke,Thiele,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Agrarpolitische Interessen Frankreichs und Deutschlands - Gemeinsamkeiten und Divergenzen unter sich ändernden Rahmenbedingungen,en_US,"Agricultural policy interests of France and Germany - similarities and divergences under changing conditions. The aim of this contribution is to examine how the French and the German positions on agricultural policy have developed since the foundation of the EEC and what the driving forces were behind. The ""general consensus"" underlying the EEC treaty, and according to which the common market would be ""conquered"" by France in the case of the classical agricultural products, could not be translated into practice; for what emerged for these products was not a customs union but a ""price support union"". As a consequence French intra-community agricultural exports had to be redirected to the world market. Thus initial positive French income transfers via intra-community trade were transformed into transfers from the EC budget, an evolution that can be interpreted as a ""modification of the general consensus"". However, this was not to last long either since the policy of price support, plus the unlimited obligation for the state to purchase any production surpluses, were bound to cause increasing budget costs and an aggravation of international trade conflicts. The fact that in the ensuing discussions on the CAP France favored price cuts while the Federal Republic pleaded for quantitative restrictions, is explained with the help of a partial analysis model. Moreover, the article also explains further divergences between the French and the German agricultural policy positions. In so doing, account is also taken of (a) the modifications of the German positions after reunification and (b) the new accents that have appeared in French agricultural policy after the change in government in 1997.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,2,Heinz,Ahrens,Christian,Lippert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,332_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

It is shown that in both countries measures are necessary to further improve competitiveness. Important strategic means are the continuation of structural change, the strengthening of the position of co-operatives, a consequent orientation towards market developments and a stronger internationalisation.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,3,Hannes,Weindlmaier,Jean-Louis,Floriot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Die Europäische Agrarpolitik im Spannungsfeld von Osterweiterung und WTO-Verhandlungen,en_US,"EU Enlargement and WTO Restrictions Shaping the CAP - A political economy analysis of the present and future CAP reform with special reference to Germany and France. The paper presents a political economy analysis of the present and future CAP reform induced under different policy scenarios regarding future EU enlargement and future WTO agreements. Theoretically, the analysis is based on a political exchange model suggested by Henning (2000). Main results are: (i) Both present and future CAP reforms are significantly biased by the political influence of farmers' lobby. (ii) In quantitative terms an EU enlargement would induce a much stronger shift in the future CAP when compared to increased WTO restrictions. (iii) The timing of the reform is important, given the fact that induced CAP reforms would be supported by a qualified majority within the EU-15, but within the EU-25 these reforms would be defeated by coalition of the new Eastern European member states using their common veto-power. (iv) The majority of political actors within the EU-15 including both politicians and interest groups evaluate induced CAP reforms negatively in comparison to the status quo, while from society's perspective these imply a positive shift of total economic welfare within EU-15.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,4,Christian H.C.A.,Henning,Thomas,Glauben,Andreas,Wald,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

This target was pursued at an international level with the foundation of the WTO. With an extensive treaty and a new dispute settlement procedure, the WTO was founded as the institutional platform for international co-operation. In view of the growing conflicts in international trade, the hope to create with this institution an international trade order, in which legally comprehensible decisions dominate and power-oriented politics are deterred, is fading. The case of the hormone dispute shows that the target of a fast harmonization of international standards cannot be reached in critical trade disputes.

,The millennium round of WTO negotiations and the future of EU agricultural policy,en_US,"The Uruguay Round has established completely new rules for agricultural trade, but not yet achieved much liberalisation. The current new round of negotiations will, therefore, have to make another big step forward. Countries' views on what exactly should be agreed in the new round still differ widely. However, it is remarkable that no country has so far doubted the validity of the new WTO rules for agriculture, nor refused to engage in serious negotiations about further reductions. The EU has so far not had major difficulties to honour the new commitments that resulted from the Uruguay Round, though in the area of export subsidies the constraints have already been felt. In the new round of negotiations, EU export subsidies will be a primary target of negotiations, given the fact that the EU grants around 88 % of all agricultural export subsidies world-wide. It will, therefore, be important for the EU to change its policies such that EU agriculture can export without subsidies. In the cereals sector, Agenda 2000 has made a notable step in this direction. For other products, though, the EU will need more reforms in the future.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,6,Stefan,Tangermann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The influence of agricultural inheritance laws on structural change in German agriculture,en_US,"The proclaimed aim of agricultural inheritance law in Germany and its preferential treatment of the farm successors is to maintain sustainable agricultural enterprises. To clarify this situation, this contribution exemplifies the financial assistance obtained through the legal situation and analyses a farm survey of about 1000 farms larger than 30 ha. As a result, it is noted that not only sustainable but also unsustainable farms are protected from division - an effect which causes delay in structural change. It is therefore suggested that the agricultural inheritance law be changed in such ways that only the so-called BGB land value law and the allocation rights included in the land trade laws are maintained. As a consequence, the incentive of the farm owner or his successor is required if special inheritance laws are to be implemented.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,7,Helmut,Doll,Ferdinand,Fasterding,Klaus,Klare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

EC Regulation 1257/99 of 17 May 1999 underlines the intention of the European Commission of an integrated rural development policy. In this paper the chances are examined that this new policy orientation offers for a more multifunctional agriculture. Possibilities for the implementation of integrated support measures at the interface of agriculture, environment and rural development are presented. First, functional relationships between agriculture and rural development are explored on the basis of three examples. This is followed by a more analytical section on relevant experiences, data and concepts. The significance of 'new', agriculture-related activities in rural areas is underlined. A paradigm shift from volumes and costs of production towards quality and value added is demanded. The paper concludes with a discussion of the perspectives for a multifunctional agriculture and a plead for rural development measures that are in support of this reorientation.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,8,Karlheinz,Knickel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

A large portion of the agri-structural policies and agri-environmental policies in the Federal Republic of Germany are decided within the framework of complex decision-making structures and fiscal responsibility at different political levels (the federal states, the national government, and the European Union), resulting in ""double-interlocked federalism"". This paper describes the specific institutional configuration and its historical development, and presents a financial analysis of the development plans for rural areas in selected federal states to illustrate the increasing role of interlocked federalism.

,Agrarpolitik als Management öffentlicher Güter: Zur Ökonomik der dezentralen Bereitstellung von Natur in der Kulturlandschaft,en_US,"Managing landscapes as public goods: on the economics of providing for nature in cultivated landscapes in decentralized ways Political procedures aimed at solving conflicts of agriculture and the environment are becoming increasingly important. In contrast to previous research, property rights solutions are regarded as inappropriate to solve the conflicts between farming and nature conservation due to transaction costs. The political process is considered as a substitute for market transactions in an agri-environment being a public good and advised as an ecological main structure (EMS). The paper addresses the problem by introducing a public manager who is responsible for the provision of an ecological main structure. It applies a political economy model of social bargaining, shows how a tragedy of the commons problem may prevail in field margin provision, and outlines a social optimum for an EMS. Finally, it provides for a solution to the problem of establishing socially acceptable rules for individuals in a political economy framework. In that solution farmers', environmentalists', and a manager's interests are considered simultaneously and the paper provides for a unified solution on the basis of a derived public objective function.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,10,Ernst-August,Nuppenau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Kompetenzverteilung in der Agrarpolitik in Deutschland,en_US,"(Re-)Distribution of responsibilities in agricultural policy in Germany: In agricultural policy in Germany institutional and functional spheres of responsibility are mixed. The constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany warrants a strong position to the federal states in relation to the federal government. But in fact, the decentralized lines of the constitutional law and the clear division of responsibilities between the federal government and the federal states have lost their contours over time. Taking the developments on the revenue side and the expenditure side together, in the national sphere in Germany there is the impression that the various governmental levels form a sturdy ""network"". Only at the level of implementation there are quite pronounced decentralized elements. There has been much critical discussion since the late 1970s of this co-operative federalism, the result of the networking of government levels. However, it has not been changed in principle. In the field of agricultural policy this networking is superimposed by the incorporation of the EU. Against the background of changed underlying conditions for integration and increased integration of European agriculture in world trade, the extensive transfer of agricultural policy responsibilities to the EU is in need of revision. In particular, the opening of the EU towards Central and Eastern Europe also requires a consideration of the mechanism of the EU agricultural policy. Recommendations from the viewpoint of fiscal federalism are discussed for a revision in competences and clear demarcation of responsibilities for different fields of agricultural policy.",,,,,2001-05-01,50,3,2001,,Articles,ART,,12,Carsten,Thoroe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,On the efficiency of farms in Brandenburg - A data envelopment analysis,en_US,"The transition of East German agriculture led to major structural adjustments that showed some very particular phenomena. For instance, most of the successors of the former agricultural production cooperatives (LPGs) make slight losses and they operate at a higher employment level than new and re-established farms. In this paper we try to explain these phenomena with the farms' history prior to the transition period. Particular attention is given to sunk costs, the identity of members and employees, and old debts. A Data Envelopment Analysis of 210 financial statements distributed over the financial years 1992/93 to 1995/96 gives evidence that these historical arguments had a decisive impact on the farms' behaviour.

Controlling for market structure variables, cyclical fluctuations in profitability are interpreted as evidence for changes in firm behaviour. The econometric panel data models reveal pro-cyclic fluctuations of profits in highly concentrated industries in Germany. In contrast, profitability in competitive industries in Germany as well as in all US food industries are found to be more stable over the business cycle. This observation is explicable in terms of a more aggressive behaviour of firms in boom periods.

Special sales offers on the one hand and continuous pricing on the other hand affect the price instability of several selected products. Altogether the grocery retail industry exerts a stabilizing effect on prices in comparison with the price instability of agricultural commodities in the world market. Different price levels for products in some retail outlets show that a mixed price calculation is used. Price elasticities in the elastic part of the demand function for four selected products indicate that consumers react strongly to price discounts at the point of sale.

Second, a radial efficiency measurement, called directional output distance function, is used to depict a long-term transformation of the production process. A non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) are used to evaluate the impact of agricultural policy changes, both in France and Germany, on the technical and environmental efficiency of arable farms, taking into account participation or not in agri-environmental programs.

,Perspectives of farm management economics,en_US,"Traditional objects of farm management research and farm management science are farms and farm households. In the course of time new objects have been added, for example different forms of horizontal and vertical co-operation, commerce and manufacturing enterprises in the field of agriculture, partly supplying, and service industries in agriculture. Corresponding to that, there are numerous addressees: relevant academics, students, farmers and their consultants, agricultural experts, also increasingly employees in agribusiness, agricultural societies and administrations, partly also jurisdiction, agrarian politicians, and finally the public. There is a large variety of topics concerning farm management research and science. Important traditional topics with varying focuses are: description of forms of enterprises, operations research and analysis, co-operate planning, appraisal, site assessment, use of electronic media, analysis of new technologies and their results, and finally the individual farm analysis of agrarian policy measures. Recent topics are in particular: economic research on organic farming, farm economic questions in connection with biotechnology and genetic engineering, farm economic controlling, internal procuring and marketing policy, business relations, analysis of international competitiveness of farm businesses as well as enterprises in agribusiness, farm environmental economy, and economic examinations of agricultural institutions. As far as organisation is concerned, farm management economics should stay in future within agricultural faculties. Farm management economics should not be classified as part of business economics and should not be integrated in business science faculties. Due to the large field of topics, farm management economics should have two professorships per faculty. Besides, a basic level of science has to be passed at any agricultural university. Above that, varied priority programs on special fields should be offered as it is currently the case.",,,,,2001-05-28,50,4,2001,,Articles,ART,,2,Manfred,Köhne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Evaluation of Agro-Environmental Programmes - A Farm Level Analysis in Baden-Württemberg and Brandenburg,en_US,"Under the condition of significant changes in the framework of EU Agricultural Policy Agro-Environmental Programmes are evaluated in this paper. The MEKA-Programme of Baden-Württemberg and the KULAP-Programme of Brandenburg, both measures under the EU-Regulation VO (EWG) 2078/92 of 1992, are analysed using farm level Linear Programming models. One of the most important results is that both, the MEKA- and the KULAP-Program, have positive environmental effects. In addition they are also responsible for significant transfer payments which under unfavourable production conditions can reach up to 40 % of the farm level gross margins. Farm structure, indicated by production conditions, crops and major production areas, is responsible for the application to the above mentioned programmes as well as for the extent of positive environmental effects. Losses in production efficiency and additional income effects are the consequence of non-consideration of the programmes offered. With respect to the results of the model calculation it is suggested that agro-environmental measures become more goal oriented and consider as far as possible regional conditions. More general programmes should become a more flexible and allow for flexible and dynamic reactions to changing circumstances.",,,,,2001-05-28,50,4,2001,,Articles,ART,,3,Patrick,Baudoux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

Econometric food demand analyses have concentrated on single products and product groups. Generally, demand functions have been estimated using single equation methods. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the food demand in former West Germany on the basis of the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) developed by DEATON and MUELLBAUER (1980). A two-stage demand system is based on data for the household type III gathered on a monthly basis during the period from 1966 to 1997. At a first stage, five aggregates of food (meats and fish; dairy and eggs; edible fats; cereals, fruits and vegetables; and other foods) and one non-food group are specified.

,The influence of the image of organic products on market development,en_US,"According to several surveys organic products widely meet consumers demand, but the corresponding market share in Germany is less than 2,5 %. Missing confidence in the authenticity of organic products, high prices compared to other foods, a low density of distribution, and a lack of a uniform label are regarded as hampering factors for market growth. The influence of the image of organic products on market development, however, is analyzed insufficiently by now. This paper therefore aims at investigating the implications of the image of organic foods on its acceptance by consumers and deriving hints for the development of the market. The actual study is based on a concept of morphological market research, the results refer to Germany and can be summarized as follows. 1. The tradition of the image of organic products is closely associated with the production methods and some kind of ascetic lifestyle. Using those products is classified as part of this lifestyle. Consumers are impressed by a concept of living that is regarded as fundamental. On the other hand perceived changes of the products and prospects for future developments are of less relevance for the image. 2. Consumers' blending of organic products and the ascetic lifestyle might be an important explanation for the low market share of organic products. 3. Positioning organic products within a market segment of tasteful foods necessarily needs to detach the connection between organic products and the ""organic lifestyle"". This is possible by co-operating with strong brands for example on the market of frozen food or baby food. 4. Moreover, sales opportunities could arise in the segment for wellness-products because organic products are regarded as healthy and thus meet the demands for products in this segment. In any case, one might take into account the competition with other constitutional foods that are produced in a substantial´ly different way, as e.g. dietary supplement or functional-food. Thus a strategy to benefit from these market opportunities could result in severe problems with the supplying farmers.",,,,,2001-06-27,50,5,2001,,Articles,ART,,3,Johannes,Simons,Carl,Vierboom,Ingo,Härlen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Opportunities and barriers for niche marketing of lamb in European LFAs based on consumer attitudes to product quality,en_US,"With commodity prices continuing to decrease and with policy constraint that farmers cannot easily increase their incomes by increasing volumes of production, they must find alternative ways to maintain their standard of living. This can be achieved by either niche marketing of agricultural products or by environmental payments, which are paid by either the government or the consumer. The results of a consumer survey carried out in Less Favoured Areas in Scotland, Germany, Greece, France and Italy to assess consumer attitudes of what constitutes the quality of lamb and the extent to which this provides an opportunity to exploit niche marketing, are discussed. Consumers generally have much less interest in the use of regional labelling, ecologically friendly production systems or the linkage of landscape and production systems in the buying decision. It is concluded that potential exists to develop niche markets for lamb and that these niches demonstrate significant regional differences. Equally, however, it is concluded that there are only limited rewards for production systems which are sympathetic to the environment. To achieve this goal, policy intervention is required, geared directly to environmental management practices. Future policy support towards farmers in LFAs is needed as a mix of policy instruments. Nowadays, financial support of farming in LFAs is necessary to grant farmers income, but structural support (e. g. in marketing products under reliable labelling towards consumers' requests with trust in the ""added values"") can help to increase LFA-farmers income without increasing subsidies.",,,,,2001-06-27,50,5,2001,,Articles,ART,,4,Gerold,Rahmann,Stuart W.,Ashworth,Jean-Pierre,Boutonnet,Gianluca,Brunori,Ioannis,Papadopoulos,,,,,,,,,,,,,35_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

The market of organic products is characterized by high asset specificity and uncertainty of transactions. Solving problems of safeguarding will be the crucial issue if organic markets shall be extended on large scale. Safeguarding is not only achieved by vertical integration but as well by market-driven forms of organization if balancing factors such as equilibrium of asset specificity between market partners, their reputation and relational marketing prevent opportunism. The exact analysis of transaction dimensions and of their balancing powers provides the basis for a market-driven safeguarding-system in the organic market, which offers often a more efficient management of safeguarding than vertical integration.

,The Dairy Sector in the Central European Candidate (CEC) Countries - The Status of Restructuring and Future Challenges,en_US,"The dairy sector in the CEC countries had to cope with tremendous adjustment pressures in the 90ies. Privatization and liberalization contributed to intense competition on the CEC countries' dairy market. Major problems that impede the competitiveness of this sector are a considerable fragmentation of the dairy processing industry, pronounced excess capacities, high seasonality of milk production and low investment activities. The latter delays the modernization of processing technologies and thus hinders quality improvements and the adjustments of hygienic conditions as well as product and process standards to EU norms. These problems are common to all CEC countries, though to different degrees. In addition, especially in Bulgaria and Romania, but also in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia the dairy industry is burdened by the low quality of the raw material and high milk collecting costs.

,Agro-food Business Strategies for Origin Labelled Products,en_US,"Traditional and typical food products are, at present, fully recognised by European Union institutions and regulations. The name Origin Labelled Products (OLPs) brings together all those food products, which have legal recognition under the EU legislation, defined as produced in a particular place or region, while complying with certain EU rules. The term includes products of either Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) or Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). Globalisation of food markets has reinforced the attractiveness of these products, as seen in the trend for consumers to appreciate locally produced products more in response to global brands and homogeneous food products. Food safety concerns among consumers, either rationally or emotionally driven, have contributed to the desire for established and traditional processes and origins in products. In this paper, the most important features that identify OLP enterprises and their business environment are described. Although they are small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), they have some distinctive features that might allow them to become more competitive. Following this, the principal characteristics of OLPs and their marketing characteristics are exposed.

This gap is partly filled by the present study of consumer perception of meat traceability in Belgium, based on cross-sectional data collected in June 2001. Respondents are segmented, based on their subjective perception of meat quality, and differences in the perceived need for traceability systems between the various segments are investigated. Functional traceability attributes, such as organizational efficiency, chain monitoring and individual responsibility, are important to all consumers. Extensions with respect to process attributes, such as production methods, are less relevant to the general population, being only of interest to specific market segments, i.e. consumers with a more negative perception of meat quality and lower consumption levels. In conclusion, it is recommended that public policy focuses on the level of functional traceability attributes, whereas extensions with respect to process attributes are left to private initiatives, which focus on specific market segments.",,,,,2001-08-31,50,6,2001,,Articles,ART,,9,Xavier,Gellynck,Wim,Verbeke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Organic Farming in Austria,en_US,"Until now, organic farming in Austria saw its largest growth in the period between 1994 and 1998. The following factors all contributed to Austria achieving the highest percentage of organic farms in Europe: the early addition of guidelines for organic crop production and animal husbandry to the Austrian Codex Alimentarius, the government support for organic farms during and after conversion through compensatory payments, favourable market conditions through the entrance of supermarket chains, the establishment of a marketing company, an active policy by the organic associations and the development of advisory services. However, this dynamic development has not persisted in the late nineties. Whether the crises in conventional production will provide organic farming with a stimulus through the ongoing strong demand for organic products cannot yet be ascertained. Although economic analyses for selected farms and regions have demonstrated the competitiveness of this farming method, under the current environment various barriers and a general reluctance remain, hampering a strong increase in the number of organic farms. In the framework of a high export rate, redoubled efforts are necessary if Austria is to remain among the countries with the highest rates of organic farms. Various initiatives aim to stimulate both the rate of conversion, particularly in cash crop areas, and the demand for organic products.",,,,,2001-11-12,50,7,2001,,Articles,ART,,4,Bernhard,Freyer,Michael,Eder,Walter,Schneeberger,Ika,Darnhofer,Leopold,Kirner,Thomas,Lindenthal,Werner,Zollitsch,,,,,,,,,55_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Förderung des ökologischen Landbaus in Deutschland: Entwicklung und Zukunftsaussichten,en_US,"Promotion of Organic Farming in Germany: Development and Perspectives for the Future. Organic farming is promoted financially in the Federal Republic of Germany since 1989. The entire segment shows a very dynamic development since that time. In the past eleven years, the organically managed land area has increased more than ten-fold. Now, a large bouquet of measures are offered which target the promotion of organic farming. Among the supports are grants for organically managed land, investment incentives, the promotion of producer co-operatives, the promotion of on-farm processing and direct marketing, publicity measures and measures to raise consumer awareness as well as the support of training, extension and research in the field of organic farming. In addition, a series of pilot and demonstration projects in the area of processing and marketing of organic products have been carried out. Since large portions of the agricultural structure and the agri-environmental policy fall under the jurisdiction of the federal states (the ""Bundesländer""), the concrete forms of the support measures as, for example the rates of payments for organically managed land, differ significantly from state to state. This is also reflected in the varying reaction of the states to the new orientation in agricultural policy taken by the federal government. It begins to emerge that the emphasis of support policy for organic farming will remain on the payment of area related premiums despite the new accents in national policy. This article identifies and discusses the current form of these support measures as well as possible approaches for further development. With regard to the total spectrum of measures promoting organic farming, a better co-ordination of the existing activities is recommended, for example within the internationally approved framework of an action plan for organic farming.",,,,,2001-11-12,50,7,2001,,Articles,ART,,5,Hiltrud,Nieberg,Renate,Strohm-Lömpcke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,A Comparison of Successful and Less Successful Organic Farms in Germany,en_US,"The conversion to organic farming has proven to be an economically interesting alternative for a large portion of the converted farms in the past. This contribution will consider the question of which factors influence the success of organic farming. The basis for the study is a series of data taken from the converting farms themselves as well as data of the farm accountancy data network. The success of conversion is measured by the profit difference in comparison to a conventional reference group, while the absolute performance of the organic farm is assessed classically on the basis of the profit per family work unit. The results show that the successful farms are more likely to be arable farms. Successful organic farms tend to produce in a more market-oriented manner. They get higher prices and produce a large number of products that can be sold for especially high prices on the organic market. As is to be expected, the successful farms also receive higher natural yields than the less successful farms and produce at a comparatively lower cost. Also, organic grants provide a lesser portion of their income, and they are thus less dependent on agricultural policies as less successful farms. A consideration of the most important socio-economic indices shows that successful farms are primarily those which are farmed full time. The farmers also have a comparatively above-average education in agriculture. A discussion of the most important consequences for politics and agricultural practice conclude this paper, drawn on the most important factors identified in the study.",,,,,2001-11-12,50,7,2001,,Articles,ART,,6,Hiltrud,Nieberg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

Any such policy should aim at enhancing network externalities within the organic sector and contribute to the development of the long-term technological potential of organic agriculture.",,,,,2001-11-12,50,7,2001,,Articles,ART,,7,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,Guido,Recke,Hendrik,Wolff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Transition to Organic Apple Production as Risky Investment,en_US,"Based on data of a survey among 18 organic apple producers in Northern Germany and complementary expert judgements the rentability of transition from conventional to organic production is analysed. It is hypothesized that changing from conventional to organic production is an investment because specific capital items are necessary for such a step. It is further hypothesized that in view of the limited experience and the very restricted availability of extension materials such investment is particularly prone to risk. The methodology applied to investigate the question of rentability and risk of the investment for the transition to organic apple production includes four steps. First, economic parameters of the 18 existing organic apple producers are being analyzed. Second, the net present value and the annuity of net benefits from transition to organic apple production is calculated. Third, the risk of such investment is analyzed by applying Monte-Carlo type stochastic simulation. This method was also used to investigate the relative advantage of different apple varieties. Finally, the effect of varietal diversification on the mean and the variance of income is investigated by using a MOTAD approach. Choices about varieties are especially important in organic apple production as this is a major tool to control pests and to achieve high prices on the market. The analysis of the survey data confirmed the observation of previous studies that a distinction between extensive and intensive organic producers is reasonable. Results showed that only intensive apple producers are likely to be economically successful. The results of investment analysis for a model farm representing the group of intensive producers showed that at a price above 1 DM per kg of apples and a yield of at least 15 t per ha put to transition is economical. Comparing these data with those from the current producers in Northern Germany, transition to organic apple may be recommended to conventional farmers if they are prepared to take the extra risk. Results of the stochastic simulation confirms the result of the analysis under certainty. When risk is taken into account organic apple production remains an interesting option for farmers who are willing to learn and innovate. Comparing four apple varieties reveals that 'Topaz', a variety resistant to apple scab, is dominating all other varieties frequently grown by organic producers. Nevertheless, planting several varieties makes economic sense when risk is taken into account. Results of the MOTAD model show the trade-off between average annuity and its variance for different portfolios. At an annuity of less than 9 000 DM per ha high diversity can be observed. On the other hand, as income expectations rise, the number of varieties in the portfolio decline. In the extreme case of more than 11 000 DM only one variety, i.e. the variety 'Topaz' remains. The paper also draws some preliminary conclusions as regards the possibilities for further economic studies on organic horticulture. It is concluded that aside from the severe data problem innovative model approaches are necessary to capture some of the real questions which are asked by the practitioners of organic farming as well as by policy makers. It appears that extending the neo-classic economic approaches by some elements of ecological economics can advance the analysis of organic farming.",,,,,2001-11-12,50,7,2001,,Articles,ART,,8,Hermann,Waibel,Hildegard,Garming,Katrin,Zander,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Price Policy for Organic Food: a Neo-institutional Approach,en_US,"Price premiums are recognized as a central barrier for the diffusion of organic food. On average, the consumer has to pay about 50 % more for organic food than for comparable products. This is also true for large retailers although considerable economies of scale could be expected. Against this background the following article analyzes pricing strategies of supermarkets. It appears evident that higher prices of organic food reflect higher costs of production and lower output, but primarily this is due to inefficient structures in processing and marketing. Furthermore, the pressures of competition in the market are low; price reductions and bargain sales are avoided by competitors. If the premium prices are compared with the results of market research, a large discrepancy between the willingness to pay for organic food and actual prices will be found. By means of a conjoint analysis the managerial inefficiencies of this pricing policy can be proven. Finally, the paper gives theoretical justification for the current pricing policy of large retailers. We present a neo-institutional organizational approach to identify reasons for imitative behaviour. Similar pricing strategies of all retailers can be considered as a process of mimetic isomorphism. Particular emphasis is placed on high managerial uncertainty and pressure of stakeholders.",,,,,2001-11-12,50,7,2001,,Articles,ART,,9,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Modeling Farm Evolution and Sustainability Goals,en_US,"In his numerous textbooks WILHELM BRANDES has laid the foundation for theoretically appropriate modeling of farm firms, which has recently been expanded to modeling sustainability goals. The published research results belong to the fields of economic, ecological, and social sustainability. Standard method for the analysis of economic sustainability is the gross margin calculation, for the given purpose extended by associated opportunity costs and/or by appropriately adding further associable branch specific costs. At an on-farm-basis the system has been developed to a management information system under sustainability goals which has been further developed to the new forms of precision agriculture by incorporating yield and soil nutrient mapping, spectroscopic crop condition information as well as use of the global positioning system. At an aggregated, sectoral and regional level the method has been adjusted for the analysis of regional opportunity costs, supply-demand-functions, quota rents etc. Research on product chain sustainability in a world wide comparison are still incipient, whereby the cost effects of environmental standards are increasingly observed. The use of farm records for describing the economic and ecological sustainability of farming systems through updating the list of indicators and by the help of appropriate evaluation routines is asked for by the addressees and needs to be further developed. In transform countries goals of social sustainability are focused at in converting former production cooperatives, collective farms, and state farms. Advanced simultaneous-dynamic planning methods in a highly disaggregative form describe not only social secondary constraints as to liabilities, social compensation plans, etc. but also as to investment and disinvestment and all cash flows by time. They allow to link farm records with the financial plan and controlling and they are as well adequate in view of the increasingly necessary risk analyses, in particular price, policy, and production risk. Ecological sustainability goals concerning for instance soil erosion, nitrate leaching, emission of greenhouse gases and toxic substances, etc. have created methodological variants of farm planning which provide for effect analyses in defining entrepreneurial adaptive paths as well as agro-ecological policy. Modules from natural science were incorporated into models optimizing farming systems holistically. On the aggregated level it was possible to join farm based models to GIS-supported landscape models. Results from such models are presented on the level of small regions and are made readily available on modern data records to addressees in landscape planning and policy. Single farm problems are modeled according to the multi agent approach, which looks at least promising in explaining findings under heavy competition for land, quotas, pollution rights, etc. Essential prerequisite for a continuing innovative development of quantitative farm planning under a sustainability objective was - amongst others - the interdisciplinary approach and the consequent adjustment of research with questions posed by addressees.",,,,,2001-11-27,50,8,2001,,Articles,ART,,2,Jürgen,Zeddies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,62_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Reale Optionen und Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre - oder: Kann man mit der Optionspreistheorie arbitrieren?,en_US,"Real Options: Concept, Methods and Applicability in Agricultural EconomicsThis paper discusses the real options approach to investment. Real options facilitate an analysis of investment under uncertainty explicitly taking into account irreversibility of the investment decision and flexibility with respect to the investment timing. This is achieved by exploiting the analogy between a financial option and an investment project. We pinpoint the relation to traditional methods of capital budgeting as well as the special features of this concept, namely the exclusion of arbitrage opportunities and the independence of individual risk preferences. Analytical and numerical solution procedures for option pricing are presented. An application to investments in hog finishing illustrates the main ideas of the real options approach. It turns out that compared to traditional investment criteria, e.g. the net present value, the optimal investment trigger is considerably higher. Hence real options give an explanation for economic hysteresis. The reason for the increase of the investment trigger is that the opportunity to delay the investment decision, i.e. the value of waiting, causes opportunity costs that have to be covered by the expected investment returns. Finally model extensions, which consider different stochastic processes, compound real options, and competition, are discussed.",,,,,2001-11-27,50,8,2001,,Articles,ART,,3,Martin,Odening,Oliver,Musshoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

While the first contribution is on aspects of general agricultural policy the following ones refer to world, EU and German commodity markets together with more specific policy items.1 Agricultural PolicyThe agricultural policy discussion in Germany was dominated last year by several political changes proposed by the new Federal Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture who came into office 12 January 2001. EU enlargement and WTO negotiations also attracted some attention but ranged behind. The change at the top of the German agricultural policy administration was made in reaction to the public's deep rooted dissatisfaction with the political handling of animal diseases (BSE, FMD) and former food scares. Political claims like ""20 % organic farming within ten years"", ""quality instead of quantity"" and ""a turnaround in agriculture"" caused much irritation among farmers. New food quality labels, stricter regulations for good husbandry (as e.g. an earlier end to hen battery cage systems in Germany, protection of animals during transport), however, pleased consumers.",,,,,2002-01-16,51,2,2002,,Articles,ART,,1,Dirk,Manegold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

Minor dents in wheat and rice production contrasted with higher output of coarse grains. World wheat prices strength-ened.Reduced plantings and lower average yields let the EU wheat crop fall by 12 per cent from the previous year. The fall was yet less than expected with regard to adverse weather in some important wheat growing areas. The second reduction of the EU intervention price through CAP reform (Agenda 2000) became effective by the beginning of the 2001/02 marketing year.

Precautionary quota management caused the beet growers associations all over the EU to issue recommendations not to over plant quotas.

With EU support prices being fixed and milk quotas raised under the Agenda 2000 the Commission tried to control the market by repeatedly adjusting subsidies for disposal of skim milk and SMP as well as on SMP and butter exports. Several member countries made changes in their sophisticated commercial quota transfer systems while the mid-term review which the Commission is committed to present in 2003 is expected to give guidance towards a later abolition of the whole EU dairy quota regime.

,Neue empirische Befunde zur Preissetzung und zum Verbraucherverhalten im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel,en_US,"New Empirical Evidence on Price Setting and Consumer Behaviour in the Retailing Sector. There are two objectives of this article: (i) It is discussed theoretically how the dynamics of pricing decisions of multiproduct retailers can be explained. (ii) It is analyzed empirically by use of scanner data how prices are actually set and how consumers react at the point of sale to price changes and promotional activities by retailers. The empirical evidence focuses on breakfast products in general and jam and breakfast cereals in particular. Main results are the following: 1. Theory of optimal pricing by multiproduct firms suggests that direct and cross price elasticities of demand and marginal costs determine the profit-maximizing price at one point of time. Good reasons do exist additionally for multiproduct retailers to vary prices intertemporally. Sales, e.g., can be consistent with optimal intertemporal pricing. 2. Scanner data for German food retailers in the period September 1996 - June 1999 are utilized in the empirical analysis. The law of one price does not hold for individual branded foods across store types. Price dispersion varies by product. The impact of sales is high in grocery retailing; on average for 20 food categories, one product of a category was on sale every other week. 3. Promotional activities affect demand for branded products strongly, but impacts on quantities varied widely. They were above average for coffee, a storeable product, below average for fresh milk, a less storeable good. In some cases, these effects are so strong that consumers seem to buy the brand only when it is on sale. 4. In the special case of jam, prices are lowest in discounters and highest in supermarkets. The spread of prices is also lowest in discounters and highest in supermarkets. Price-elastic reactions at the point of sale was, however, a uniform pattern across all store types of grocery retailing. The strongest reaction was found in supermarkets with a price elasticity of demand of -5.09.5. For breakfast cereals, strong reactions by consumers occur to various promotional activities. Impacts on demand were, e.g., as high as 175 % when the instruments sales, display and leaflet were combined. Sales were an important feature of promotional activities with a strong demand-increasing effect. Summing up, it can be concluded that an active price policy of grocery retailers is a crucial component of their marketing mix. This is compatible with the finding of a strong price responsiveness of consumers. The stylized fact that the price elasticity of food demand is absolutely low, may be correct for aggregate demand but is not confirmed at the store level. On the contrary: High absolute levels of the store-level price elasticity of demand are typical for branded foods.",,,,,2002-02-05,51,2,2002,,Articles,ART,,7,Roland,Herrmann,Anke,Möser,Elke,Werner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Beitragsnovellierung in der landwirtschaftlichen Unfallversicherung - Notwendigkeit und Vorschläge,en_US,"Amendment of the Premiums for the Agrarian Accident InsuranceMany German farmers do no longer accept the annual premiums for the state accident insurance, which sometimes reach a considerable degree. The farmers are of the opinion that the specific accident risk of each farm has to be taken into account. So far, the agrarian professional associations as representatives of the state accident insurance, predominantly measure the premium standards by acre/ hectare which no longer fulfils the equivalence principle.The merger of some agrarian professional associations, which take place at present or are planned in the near future, should be regarded as an opportunity to institutionalize new and more appropriate premium standards. They have to be adapted anyway, as a merger usually means the standardization of two or more different premium standards. Inevitably there will be redistributions of the premium burden. The present time is ideal to use simultaneously a premium standard that is viable in the future.

,Economics of Food and Feedstuffs Safety with Special Regard to Law Enforcement,en_US,"The objective of this article is to describe and to analyse the basic relationships between control frequency, amount of fines, other social sanctions, the producers' capability to influence certain attributes (including costs of quality assurance) and damage incidence in the field of food and feedstuffs safety. For this purpose an economic model is developed that minimizes monitoring costs including (a) the harm prevented and (b) the revenues from fines. First, monitoring measures are optimized by exclusively taking account of the interests of consumers and taxpayers. In a second step, the model is enlarged by adding constraints relative to the costs of quality assurance so that aspects of both producer welfare and total social costs are explicitly accounted for when simultaneously optimizing the probability of detection and the degree of punishment.The results derived from the model show among other things:-From an economic point of view legal regulation (i.e. the setting of performance standards) is advisable only in cases of comparatively high potential damages.-Even when the entire production is to be free from certain residues, it is often not necessary to check all units of the commodity considered.-In the presence of (a) poor possibilities to influence an attribute - or a wide range of quality assurance costs among producers - and (b) prospective damages which justify a control frequency of one hundred percent, no fines at all should be stipulated in order to avoid allocative distortions.-In the case of strong social sanctions (e.g. losses of reputation), all else being equal the control frequency may be lowered considerably.Against the background of these conclusions the application of uniform control frequencies is inappropriate. Instead, every food control authority should be free to choose the size of samples, taking into account not only the given structure of fines but also its knowledge concerning the market specific social sanctions, monitoring costs, the extent of potential damages from legal transgressions as well as the producers' possibilities and costs of influencing the relevant food or feedstuffs attributes.",,,,,2002-03-19,51,3,2002,,Articles,ART,,2,Christian,Lippert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

However, empirical research on diversification in European agricultural markets is very limited.

The results of fixed- and random-effect models for approx. 3900 farms in Schleswig-Holstein for the period 1988/89-1997/98 show that diversification into related products increases growth rates whereas the opposite applies for diversification into unrelated products.

The main focus of the present article is the US import regime for cheese which was transformed according to the tariffication process into a TRQ system.

,The New Role of Social Security in Rural Areas of Developing Countries,en_US,"In the 1990ies the ultimate target of social security has been widened: Social security aims at protecting people against life risks and helping them to take advantage of social and economic opportunities. Existing social security systems in rural areas of developing countries are often ""second best solutions"" and need reforms. Institutional innovations such as micro insurance schemes are a promising way of improving the risk management of rural households. The example of community based health insurance schemes in Senegal shows, that rural households can be successfully integrated into insurance schemes. This allows a better access to health care and is an essential prerequisite for increasing labour productivity. Moreover, it offers in the mid to long term the chance to shift to more risky but also more profitable production systems. The discussion of the appropriate design of social security in rural areas of developing countries has yet started. Many questions are still open as e.g. the willingness of rural households to pay for insurance products, the optimal design of micro insurance schemes and the measurement of the effects of social security on productivity. Agricultural economics research can make substantial contributions in answering these questions.",,,,,2002-04-30,51,4,2002,,Articles,ART,,3,Johannes P.,Jütting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,87_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Economic Situation and Development Perspectives of Farms in Poland - An Analysis Based on Survey Data from Selected Polish Voivodships and a Comparison with German Farms,en_US,"The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of farm-level data collected in a survey of 464 Polish farms in 2000. Performance indicators of farms in three Polish voivodships are compared with farm accountancy data from two German Länder. The results show that Polish farms are much less profitable than their German counterparts. The gap in income levels is much higher between persons employed in the agricultural sector than between average working persons in the two countries. Living standards of the Polish farm population in the north-west exceed those in the south-east of the country. The analysis suggests that the lower profitability of farms has two major reasons. First, farms in the German regions receive much higher levels of subsidies. Second, there are pronounced structural deficiencies due to a quite unfavourable workforce-land ratio on Polish farms. These farms are less productive and less specialised than the German farms analysed. There is a generally conservative attitude among Polish farmers that prefers the continuation of farming over leaving the sector. Nevertheless, income from agriculture is to a substantial extent complemented by off-farm employment in the southern regions. Our overall conclusion is that Polish farms currently are in the midst of a regional, economic, and social differentiation process fuelled by severe imbalances in terms of income levels between rural and urban population groups. This process is however seriously slowed down or even halted by a number of effective institutional barriers, particularly with regard to rural labour markets. These barriers should be properly addressed by a formulation of future policies in order to avoid further social frictions in the course of the Polish EU accession.",,,,,2002-04-30,51,4,2002,,Articles,ART,,4,Martin,Petrick,Grzegorz,Spychalski,Michal,Switlyk,Ewa,Tyran,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,84_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

We assess this rule in the light of modern economic theory. It is shown that the RAC is efficient, if conventional agriculture is competitive without other payments. In regions where agriculture is not competitive though and is said to be important for ecological purposes the payments for ecological services must exceed additional costs. In these cases three criteria exist to prevent trade distortions as far as possible: the regions in which farmers are eligible to more than additional costs must be clearly defined by economic and ecological indicators, payments must not exceed the costs for equivalent nature conservation measures by non-farmers and the ecological benefit of the farmer's actions must be demonstrated. The definition of the regions where more than additional costs can be paid should be made at the EU-level if the ecological importance of these regions is of international concern.",,,,,2002-06-21,51,5,2002,,Articles,ART,,2,Karin,Holm-Müller,Heinz Peter,Witzke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,88_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Steuerung der Landnutzung durch Raumplanung: Instrumente und Kooperationsprobleme zwischen Landwirtschaft und Naturschutz,en_US,"Managing the Use of Land by Means of Regional Planning: Instruments and Collaboration Problems between the Farming Community and Nature ConservationAfter describing a series of plans with implications for land use, this study aims to examine the collaboration problems which exist between the main groups involved and elaborate on potential legal solutions. Main results are the following:1. German law requires that the interests of the farming community and nature conservation are taken into account in the overall consideration of planning decisions. Any specialist plans already available - bearing in mind the different procedures existing between the various federal states - must also be integrated into the planning process. 2. If farming interests or the interests of nature conservation and countryside protection cannot be asserted in the overall planning process as laid down by the law, the decisions are in many cases political and, as such, cannot be dealt with by legal means. In legal terms, the interests are already recognised as having equal status.3. The rivalry frequently encountered between the farming community and nature conservation over the use of land mostly occurs when the land is intended to be used for other purposes (i.e. for housing development, infrastructure etc.). The necessity for conservation-related compensation creates a relationship of tension which in many cases is not directly attributable to nature conservation and farming. An example is the low amount of conservation-related compensation when viewed in comparison with a housing development project.4. The law only partially regulates the coordination of nature-preservation and agrarian specialist planning. However, both sides - the farming community (consideration of high-yielding land) and conservation (upgrading the chances of realising landscape planning) have an equal interest in seeing coordinated measures implemented at an early stage. In practice, an adequate procedure has already been developed. In legal terms, however, it is difficult to register and cope with the possibilities and problems associated with the informal methods of coordination.5. Ultimately, the success of the coordination and collaboration depends largely on the commitment shown by the parties involved. However, the coordination of regional planning instruments at an early stage does not solve the problems of acceptance between the farming community and nature conservation as long as the realisation of legal conservationist measures are financially unattractive for farmers or could even jeopardise their existence.",,,,,2002-07-30,51,6,2002,,Articles,ART,,3,Kathrin,Exler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,97_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Konzeptionelle Potenziale des schweizerischen Direktzahlungsregimes für die EU,en_US,"What Potentials Does the Swiss Direct Payment Regime Offer for the CAPThe paper has the goal to check whether elements of the Swiss direct payment regime could serve as a model for the EU. It does so by checking the direct payment regime’s accordance with the concept of an efficient and sustainable economic policy and by quantitatively examining what impact it has if some of its elements are integrated into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It becomes clear that Swiss agricultural policy roots much firmer in the foundations of public finance theory than the CAP, but that an adaptation in the EU would lead either to large budget increases or to massive income losses for farmers. However, the Swiss example shows that large direct payments can be brought into accordance with public finance theory.",,,,,2002-11-04,51,8,2002,,Articles,ART,,2,Stefan,Mann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,112_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Struktur-, Effizienz- und Einkommenswirkungen von Direktzahlungen",en_US,"Structural Efficiency and Income Effects of Direct PaymentsThe paper analyses various forms of direct payments using the agent-based model AgriPoliS. The model is fitted to the agricultural region 'Hohenlohe' in Baden-Württemberg which is characterised by intensive livestock farming. The policy simulations show that decoupled payments which are attached to land do not have significant effects on structural change, competitiveness, and income as compared to the current Agenda 2000 policy. In order to reach a significant and lasting effect on the competitiveness of agriculture direct payments would have to be granted independently of production, land use, and farming activity in general. In order to ensure a sufficient degree of land management, area payments should be decreased to an extent which is just necessary to maintain certain land management standards. In an agricultural region where most land is leased, such a policy would break with the effect that only a small fraction of the income payment stays with the tenant, but is transferred to the land owner. It is especially the farms with a growth potential and a high share of rented land that would benefit from such a policy. The final section of the paper discusses the results in the light of the used modelling approach and with respect to future policy formation.",,,,,2002-11-04,51,8,2002,,Articles,ART,,3,Katrin,Happe,Alfons,Balmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,113_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Auswirkungen einer Entkopplung von Ausgleichszahlungen auf den EU-Getreidemarkt,en_US,"Impacts of a Decoupling of Direct Payments on the EU Cereals Market: The proposals for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy within the Mid Term Review of the European Commission fueled the discussion about the future of direct payments to farmers. The EU Commission recommends a decoupling of animal and area payments from the production by granting these direct payments as a payment claim per hectare of eligible farm land. However, introducing area tied payments the intended shift of payments from the produce to the producer will not take place, but instead an increased transfer of payments to land owners seems likely. This study therefore analyses the impacts of changing the area payments for grand cultures into person-tied payments on the cereals market of the European Union. For the assessment of impacts homogenous natural locations are clustered. The clustering is based on the regional reference yields for cereals and the share of arable land of total agricultural area in different farm types of the regions. For these production locations total production costs for cereals, oilseeds, and protein crops are calculated as a function of the farm size in order to estimate a cost reduction potential subject to structural changes within agriculture. The main results are the following: 1) Prerequisites are good for the EU to cultivate cereals since a major part of the production is located in highly competitive regions. Thus the EU would remain a net exporter of cereals even producing under world market conditions. However, maintaining the intervention price system while abolishing the set-aside obligation could lead to an uncontrolled increase of cereal stocks. 2) Even on highly competitive locations a significant structural change is required in order to reduce costs and to yield profits without area payments. Depending on the development of the world market prices for cereals the model calculations find a reduction of the work force between 20 000 and 50 000 labor units.3) Without area payments the profits per hectare and thus the rents would decrease notably and therefore result in a corresponding income loss for land owners. An exclusive granting of payment claims to the producers would in particular affect former farmers, whose rental incomes contribute substantially to their pension plans.",,,,,2002-11-04,51,8,2002,,Articles,ART,,4,Horst,Gömann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,115_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Impacts and Alternative Options of Modulation of Direct Payments,en_US,"The system of direct payments in the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is being criticised with respect to the level, unequal distribution and allocation effects on production. Besides the decoupling of direct payments a modulation and a partial transmission to the second pillar of CAP are proposed. Modulation on a voluntary basis was already introduced in Agenda 2000. In its Mid-term Review of the Agenda the Commission proposes an obligatory dynamic modulation scheme including the capping of direct payments beyond a threshold of 300 000 Euro. Possible impacts of the Commission's proposal are assessed with simulations based on farm accounting data of EU-FADN. Distribution effects between farm sizes and member states are unveiled. Alternate options with regard to capping and progressive reductions of direct payments are analysed. Due to the different distribution of direct payments, farms of EU Member states will be affected differently by the proposal of the Commission: The franchise of 5 000 Euro will exempt from modulation about tw -thirds of farms being represented by FADN respectively 15 % of the premium volume. About 80 % of the volume are subject to proportional reductions and 5 % fall off due to capping. More than four fifths of the capping affects Eastern Germany alone.The capping measurement leads to large distributional effects between farm sizes and between member states: In the first step of the dynamic modulation, premia beyond the franchise are reduced by 3 % while they are totally taken away beyond the capping threshold. Direct payments to large farms in Eastern Germany would be reduced by more than half. Due to drastic income shortfalls farm adaptations by splitting-up the farm enterprises or reducing the number of hired workers would be induced. An alternate scheme of modulation based on a progressive reduction of direct payments has been proposed. Elements of this system are a franchise, dynamic progressive reductions of direct payments within a progressive zone and proportional premia reductions beyond the upper limit of the progressive zone. There is no capping and with regard to administration purposes no other factors than the level of direct payments are included. With the determination of a few parameters — the franchise, the progression zone and the minimum and maximum rates of reduction — the system can be handled flexibly in view of social and budgetary objectives. Compared to the Commission's proposal farms entitled to less than 100 000 Euro of direct payments would forfeit less money under the progressive reductions system. Farms entitled to 100 000 to 300 000 Euro of direct payments would lose moderately more. Among the large farms however, premia reductions would be distributed more evenly and never exceed the maximum rate of e.g. 35 % while by the capping as proposed by the Commission affected farms could lose much more with the average loss increasing from 35 to 42 % of original entitlements.",,,,,2002-11-04,51,8,2002,,Articles,ART,,5,Werner,Kleinhanss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,119_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Influence of Per-hectare Premiums on Prices for Rented Agricultural Area and on Agricultural Land Prices,en_US,"Within the framework of decreasing support for agricultural incomes by market measures, the per-hectare premiums (ha-premiums) clearly have the task and the effect to stabilise farm incomes. Before direct aids were introduced, there had been periods with decreasing prices for agricultural land and for rented agricultural area in real terms, according to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data base (specialised crop farms in 53 regions for 11 years) and EUROSTAT data (B, DK, D-W, F, NL in the period 1975 to 1999).Regression analysis is used to show the relationship between ha-premiums, land rental prices and other relevant economic variables, such as land prices, rental share, livestock density, the price index of agricultural products and farm income. The analysis shows increasing price effects due to the introduction of ha-premiums on prices for agricultural land and on rental prices. Landlords received a share of about 6 % to 18 % of the ha-premiums (depending on the data source). An in-sample simulation, 1999-continuation scenario, and scenarios of further CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reforms are used for the assessment of the ex-post and ex-ante developments. The ongoing reforms of the CAP (Agenda 2000, Mid-term Review) and EU enlargement certainly have implications for the land markets.",,,,,2002-11-04,51,8,2002,,Articles,ART,,6,Clemens,Fuchs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,117_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

On the basis of the partial equilibrium model ESIM this article analyses potential consequences of different options for a reformed CAP. While the impact on agricultural markets will be relatively small, the financial burden of a harmonisation of agricultural policies and an introduction of direct payments in the new member states has to be carried mainly by the old member states of the EU-15. The burden of the main net-payers, especially Germany, would be significantly lower, if CAP were reformed according to the proposals of the EU-Commission's Mid-term Report. However, the remaining negative impacts on world agricultural trade and on world market prices for agricultural products, clearly show the necessity of a further reform of the CAP.",,,,,2002-11-05,51,8,2002,,Articles,ART,,7,Martin,Banse,Ferdinand,Nölle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,103_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Zur Bedeutung von EU-Direktzahlungen für landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen in Ungarn,en_US,"Impacts of EU Direct Payments on Agricultural Enterprises in HungaryDirect payments are a controversial issue in the accession negotiations. While the EU proposes reduced payments the accession countries claim that they should be equally treated as the present EU members.The present study, based on micro-simulations on the farm level, shows impacts of various policy options (ranging from non-accession to the granting of full direct payments) on the production structure and profitability of Hungarian agricultural enterprises.For most products prices are expected to be higher in 2004 than in the reference year, 2001. EU accession will have an additional positive effect on the prices of all products. Direct payments would further increase farm profits. In particular crop producers would benefit (due to the increase in the price of corn) while profits in animal production would be affected in a negative way due to increased opportunity costs of forage area and higher labour cost.The presented figures are based on data collected in 14 typical model farms selected from the Hungarian Farm Accountancy Data Network and they cannot be regarded perfectly representative. However, in accordance with other sector studies the figures allow two conclusions. First, the majority of Hungarian agriculture (with respect to the share in total farm area as well as the share in total standard gross margins) would suffer no economic harm from an EU accession without direct payments. Second, direct payments would increase farm profits in Hungary considerably.",,,,,2002-11-05,51,8,2002,,Articles,ART,,8,Ludger,Hinners-Tobrägel,Kristián,Keszthelyi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,105_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Budgetary Effects of Including the CEC into Dynamic Modulation,en_US,"The EU Commission suggests to exclude CEC from the dynamic modulation mechanism, being part of the MTR package. This article looks at the distributional aspects of including the CEC into dynamic modulation. Under the current accession proposal the CEC would account for only 18% of the rural development budget by 2006. If modulation would be realised with the CEC being excluded this share would drop to 14% by 2010. According to the criteria proposed by the Commission for the distribution of the modulation budget the CEC would get a higher share of the modulation budget if they were included as they account for high shares in agricultural area and employment, and their GDP per capita is relatively low. Based on the assumptions made for this article they would be eligible for about 66% of the modulation budget. As a result of their participation in the modulation mechanism their share in the rural development budget would be at 30% by 2010. The financial net gains for the CEC from participation are estimated to be at 1.7 bln.

,Polish Agriculture under Different Policy Scenarios: Impacts on Production and Farm Income,en_US,"The aim of the paper is to examine impacts of different rates of direct payments on production structures and farm incomes of Polish family farms after the accession to the EU. Analyses have been made for 2004, the assumed year of accession, with the use of a linear programming farm optimisation model. 15 farm types, further differentiated by soil quality, have been selected for the study. The modelling results show, that depending on the respective policy scenario (i.e. the rate of direct payments) the introduction of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in Poland may cause some shifts in farm production. Under the conditions of Agenda 2000 and with 25 % of direct payments, as proposed by the European Commission, farm incomes would in 2004 approximately equate the 2001/2002 base level.

,Agricultural Policy 2002,en_US,"The agricultural policy discussion in Germany was dominated last year by the European Commission's Mid-term Review of the Agenda 2000 and by the process of EU enlargement. Proceedings at WTO issues were less visible to the public but the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations remained present in all discussions at least as a key argument in favour of continued agricultural policy reform. The Mid-term Review proposed some further reductions in price support and unexpectedly called for a deeprooted change in direct payments. Besides advocating a complete decoupling of payments it suggested a progressive decrease in the level of direct payments in order to save monetary resources for funding measures of more general rural development. With regard to EU enlargement, negotiations have finally been completed due to further compromises especially in the fields of financial transfers and agricultural quotas.

,Die Märkte für Schlachtvieh und Fleisch,en_US,"Meat MarketNational and international meat markets recovered in 2002 from the disturbances recently caused by animal diseases (BSE, FMD). Relaxed trade restrictions allowed world trade to grow at an overall rate of 2.5 per cent as against only 1 per cent in 2001. In several world regions as e.g. North America, Oceania and Russia, however, higher beef production also resulted from increased slaughter due to widespread draught. Initial prospects of rising beef prices could therefore not gain ground. With a rate of around 3 per cent world pig meat production is likely to have increased even faster than beef. It may have slightly surpassed a total of 94 mt in 2002. Trade in pig meat was stimulated yet only at depressed prices. Similar developments characterised the world markets of mutton, lamb and goat meat while the upward trend of poultry meat production continued at somewhat reduced annual rates.EU Member countries exhibited varying trends in beef production and consumption. EU beef exports still struggle to resume pre-BSE levels and the WTO quota of allowed subsidised exports was filled at only 60 per cent in 2001. Pig meat consumption rose a bit in 2001 at the expense of exports and without attracting higher imports. In 2002, however, another increase in pig meat exports is expected but again without WTO restrictions to become binding. Poultry meat production and consumption continue to increase in the EU with around 70 per cent of EU production falling to chicken. With various processed and convenience products, however, turkey (20 per cent of EU poultry production) remains the most dynamic section in the poultry market.",,,,,2003-01-08,52,1,2003,,Articles,ART,,4,Friedrich-Wilhelm,Probst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,121_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Unternehmensführung und Unternehmenserfolg,en_US,Management and Entrepreneurial SuccessStarting point of the analysis are theoretical considerations about multi-causal reasons of the management influence on the entrepreneurial success. In the further continuation an economic model illustrating the guidance idea of multi-causality is presented as well as a statistical evaluation method coordinated with it. Basis for the statistical illustration of the multi-causal context is an causal-analytic evaluation procedure. A priori formulated causal relations between not observable exogenous and endogenous variables are illustrated by a structural model. The structural model corresponds to the logical starting point of the regression analysis to provide documentary evidence of cause and effect relations. The latent variables of the regression-analytic part are measured by observed indicator variables.The measuring model itself is closely related to the logical starting point of the factor analysis. The causal-analytic evaluation procedure thus links the measuring models with cause and effect models.The formulation and examination of hypotheses are explained by case studies as a result of limited data. It refers only to the context between the market-focused management and the entrepreneurial success on the one hand as well as production and technology-oriented management and the entrepreneurial success on the other. Further unresolved tasks like further dimensions of the management - like employee orientation or financial orientation - have to be analysed more in detail. This task also gains significance because changes in the relative relevance of the identified management dimensions are to be expected.,,,,,2003-01-29,52,2,2003,,Articles,ART,,2,Volker,Petersen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,125_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

The paper starts with a description of traditional VaR models, i.e. Variance-Covariance-Method (VCM) and Historical Simulation (HS). We address two well known problems, namely the fat tailedness of return distributions and the time aggregation of VaR forecasts. Afterwards, Extreme-Value-Theory (EVT) is introduced in order to overcome these problems. The previously described methods are then used to calculate the VaR of hog production under German market conditions. It turns out that EVT, VCM, and HS lead to different VaR forecasts if the return distributions are fat tailed and if the forecast horizon is long. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these rather new risk management methods thereby trying to identify fields for potential applications in the agribusiness.",,,,,2003-01-29,52,2,2003,,Articles,ART,,3,Martin,Odening,Jan,Hinrichs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,128_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Basic Considerations of a Decoupling of Direct Payments within the EU,en_US,"This paper analyses theoretically the consequences of decoupling and argues for a wider discussion among agricultural economists and the public. Quantitative work on forecasting the consequences seems to be problematic in general. We ask, if the allocation of land will change that dramatically, in particular, we wonder whether set-aside will increase that much as some research and statements argue if direct payments are abolished or decoupled from land use. Taking into account economies of scale that can be realised because of faster change in the farming structure, adapted behaviour of farmers due to dramatic changes in the subsidisation scheme, technological progress, and price changes of factors and products in farmers’ benefit we conclude that most quantitative forecasts probably overestimate the changes in land allocation. Social objectives that may be incorporated with agricultural land use are analysed as well as the efficiency of direct payments to achieve these objectives. Distributional effects of income are taken into consideration, too. We recommend that politicians should decide as soon as possible to abolish or adirect payments stepwise over some years. Farmers should be aware of an end for the direct payments and should keep high flexibility to adapt to the future as easy as possible. Therefore, they should avoid investments with a high portion of sunk costs and they should analyse their capital use, especially on marginal land. Further on, they should try to reduce costs by increasing the size of farms and acres.",,,,,2003-03-17,52,3,2003,,Articles,ART,,3,Gunnar,Breustedt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,150_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Coupling of Agricultural Economic and Hydrological Models,en_US,"The objective of the paper is to show the potential of interdisciplinary model networks consisting of agricultural economic and natural science models performing integrated impact assessments of agri-environmental policies. The potentials are exemplified using a coupling of the agricultural sector model RAUMIS with the hydrological models GROWA98 and WEKU in the scope of diffuse agricultural nitrogen immission into waterbodies. A brief classification of applied indicators is given. A key element for policy impact analyses are the relationships between the environmental indicator categories Driving Force, State and Response. The major relationships within this environmental scope as well as the modeling are explained. The presented model network represents a first area wide, regionally differentiated, consistent link-up between the Driving Force indicator “nitrogen balance surplus”, the State indicator “nitrogen(nitrate)concentration” and the response indicators. The results show that due to the local characteristics quite different shares of the agricultural nitrogen surplus finally enters the ground and surface waters. Hence, assessing the trade-offs of agri-environmental water protection measures requires an inclusion of natural local characteristics. The integrated consideration of the complex relationships and a comprehensive implementation of local characteristics allows to develop more efficient water pollution control measures.",,,,,2003-04-29,52,4,2003,,Articles,ART,,4,Horst,Gömann,Peter,Kreins,Ralf,Kunkel,Frank,Wendland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,155_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Analysis of the Impacts of Different Agrarian Policy Scenarios on the Profitability of Grassland Management in Water Protection Areas by Use of a Farm Planning Programme,en_US,"The present study is based on micro-simulations on the farm level (7 dairy farms in Lower Saxony). It shows the effect of transformation of livestock premiums in hectare premiums on the profitability of grassland management. The following scenarios were analysed: Introduction of a grassland premium (77 €/ha), increase of the grassland premium to 179 €/ha and abolition of the maize premium, uniform area premium (307 €/ha), combination model (crop premium 307 €/ha, grassland premium 205 €/ha, dropping of all animal premiums except for the milk and bull premiums). The calculations show, that a grassland premium of 77 €/ha would not lead to any considerable adjustment reactions. The simultaneous dropping of the maize premium and the increase in the grassland premium (179 €/ha) would lead to small advantages for the grassland economy. A uniform hectare premium (307 €/ha) would lead to strong income redistributions between the examined enterprises (up to +/-50 €/ha). Loss of grassland on favourable sites would continue. On unfavourable sites grassland fallow would considerably increase. The combination model would lead to less serious income redistributions. Taking along effects on marginally used grassland and the rise of land rental prices would be less pronounced. Grassland fallow will not have any significant effects on the quality of the groundwater recharge. With regards to nature conservation aims substantial problems will arise, since the extensive use of pasture will not be partially financed any more through animal premiums.",,,,,2003-04-29,52,4,2003,,Articles,ART,,5,Manfred,Bathke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,156_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Analysis of Trade and Environmental Policy Options on the Basis of a National Agricultural Sector Model with Multifunctional Outputs,en_US,"SummaryStudies on liberalisation normally do not take into account the external benefits and costs of agriculture. Empirical studies on the valuation of externalities should be integrated into quantitative modelling. MULTSIM is a national supply model of agriculture. Besides commodity output the model depicts also external benefit linked to landscape preservation and external environmental costs of agriculture. Internalisation scenarios are defined showing that the reduction of commodity-linked support and the introduction of land subsidies and intermediate input taxes have differentiated impacts on the farm types’ competitiveness. A comprehensive policy approach to multifunctional agriculture requires market feedbacks to be taken into account. Internalising externalities may lead to a strong reduction of commodity output quantities. This gives rise to expectations that commodity prices would increase, which in turn would dampen the production impacts. As a consequence MULTSIM should be regarded as a bridge tool that may be linked to microeconomic based multi market models and agricultural trade models. A further strain of model development is an improved consideration of multiple policy objectives.",,,,,2003-04-29,52,4,2003,,Articles,ART,,7,Gerald,Weber,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,158_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

From the point of view of the single farm this tax norm has an excellent effect. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the whole agricultural sector the advantage of this tax norm is rather questionable both with regard to agriculture in special as well as the national economy in general. The rising prices for land due to § 6b EStG can have a negative effect on highly efficient farming businesses which are willing to expand, but have to finance the expansion soleley with the business earnings. Still, further disadvantages may result from § 6b EStG.

,Institutionelle Grundlagen der Agrarprotektion: Eine polit-ökonomische Analyse der Agrarpolitik in den Mittel- und Osteuropäischen Ländern,en_US,"The impact of political institutions, e.g. the organization of legislature, election and party systems, on agricultural protection has hardly been taken into account explicitly in theoretical and empirical studies, yet. In this framework the paper investigates to what extent political institutions explain observed variances in the political power of the agrarian population in the ten Central and Eastern European Countries / Candidates (CEEC) applying for an accession to the EU. Moreover, it is analyzed to what extent EU-accession will be politically feasible given the specific political and economic framework conditions of the individual states. In particular, empirical analyses imply the following results: (i) The political power of the agrarian population varies significantly among the analyzed countries. (ii) The political weights are significantly determined by political institutions. (iii) Analyzing to what extent EU-accession is politically feasible in the CEEC-states we can show that political feasibility of EU-accession crucially depends on keeping the rule of financial solidarity. Contrary, keeping the rule of financial solidarity implies that future CAP will become even more inefficient in economic terms.",,,,,2003-10-24,52,6,2003,,Articles,ART,,2,Christian H.C.A.,Henning,Kim Carolin,Krause,Carsten,Struve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,164_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

It is not clear to what extent the package will influence production decisions. This study proposes a simple method for incorporating the effect of direct payments into the analysis of cow herd response. Effective support prices are derived by adjusting the Agenda 2000 reductions in dairy and beef support prices to reflect the compensation given to farmers in terms of direct payments and premiums. Following the Mid-Term Review different assumptions are made with respect to the extent to which these payments are, or are perceived as being coupled to production.

,Welfare economics of conventional vs. alternative agriculture,en_US,"We develop a agricultural model assuming that conventional production is causing environmental externalities while more benign alternative production methods generate non-market amenity benefits and obtain a price premium in the marketplace. We analyze policies targeting external benefits and costs to capture interaction effects: polluting input taxes reduce the returns and subsidies needed to induce more benign production. Thus, it is only optimal to subsidize if the additional marginal amenity benefit exceeds the marginal external cost reductions due to the input tax. Terms of trade effects imply that large (land abundant) exporters have strategic incentives to overvalue external costs while large (land scarce) importers have strategic incentives to overrate non-market benefits.

,Verfahren zur Korrektur des Embedding-Effektes bei der Kontingenten Bewertung - Approaches to calibrate the amount of embedding in contingent valuation,en_US,"The use of economic tools such as the benefit-cost analysis often requires determining non-market values of environmental goods. One of the appropriate measures to determine these values is the contingent valuation. As a stated preference technique it allows to measure non-use values as well as to value future states of the environment. However, the credibility of the contingent valuation is still under debate because people only state a hypothetical willingness to pay. One of the most debated elicitation effects of this method is the embedding effect. In this paper, two approaches to take account of that effect are presented. Both use follow-up questions in order to obtain self reports from respondents. Each approach was employed in one of two contingent valuation studies which aimed at determining people’s willingness to pay for nature conservation. The answers to the debriefing questions are analysed for each survey both for the whole sample as well as separately for users and non-users of the good in question.",,,,,2003-12-04,52,8,2003,,Articles,ART,,2,Jürgen,Meyerhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,172_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Bewertung von Landschaftsfunktionen mit Choice Experiments - Valuation of landscape functions using choice experiments,en_US,"The first application of choice experiments as an environmental valuation method in Germany clearly demonstrates the potential of this method for the valuation of agriculture's multifunctionality. Choice experiments are a reasonable enhancement of the conjoint analysis as they are capable of calculating the theoretically correct welfare measures in the form of implicit prices. In combination with business and ecological models this allows for the comprehensive valuation of agriculture's multifunctionality in the sense, that in addition to the supply or cost side of land use scenarios the demand or benefit side is accounted for. In this study the integrated ecological and economical valuation of land use scenarios was demonstrated for two different scenarios. The welfare changes for the regional population due to changes in the quality or quantity of several landscape functions like drinking water quality, biodiversity, food production and landscape aesthetics were calculated. The inclusion of both supply and demand in this cost-benefit study is an important step forward for the development of sustainable land use concepts.",,,,,2003-12-04,52,8,2003,,Articles,ART,,3,Kim,Schmitz,P.

,Ermittlung der Nachfrage nach ökologischen Gütern der Landwirtschaft - Das Northeim-Projekt - The demand for ecological goods in decentralised agri-environmental payment schemes,en_US,"This paper presents a case study on the development and implementation of a decentralised and outcome-based agri-environmental payment scheme in a project region in central Germany. A research group from Goettingen University together with local actors designed the scheme which complies with the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy. The core of the programme is the creation of a market for ecological goods, in this case: of plant diversity standards in agriculture. Supply is provided by the local farmers, who, in an open competitive bidding, offer to produce as much as they are willing to of the commodity in question. The local population has to be seen as the beneficiary of these environmental goods. In the project, it is represented by a Regional Advisory Board which expresses the demand for plant diversity (i) by defining the goods and (ii) by allocating the funds to the respective goods. Hence, these plant diversity goods are treated as merit goods. To justify this approach, results from a contingent valuation study that focused on the respondents’ decision behaviour are applied. These results show that the utility expected from the provision of these goods is substantial and that ecological goods are considered as personally relevant. Based on these findings, the paper discus-ses the provision of ecological goods as merit - as opposed to private - goods.",,,,,2003-12-05,52,8,2003,,Articles,ART,,5,Anke,Fischer,Sonja K.,Hespelt,Rainer,Marggraf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,174_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Die monetäre Bewertung von Naturgütern zwischen ökonomischer Theorie und politischer Umsetzung - Monetary valuation of the natural environment - economic theory and application in environmental policy,en_US,"During the past 15 or so years, a considerable number of valuation studies have been published in German language concerning nature conservation mostly in the agrarian countryside, using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). These are documented here and briefly commented on. In the sequel, well-known objections in the literature against this method are discussed and rejected or at least attenuated, thereby referring to more comprehensive literature. Upon careful design, the results from CVM studies bear closer examination as to their reliability. It seems doubtful, however, and must even be regarded as refuted in some special cases that their very objective, as formulated from a rigorous microeconomic position, is achieved, that is the disclosure of the Compensating Variation (VC) or Equivalent Variation (EV), respectively. Respondents’ statements are influenced both by their experience in achieving a consumer surplus in everyday purchases and - more importantly - by normative, ethical, distributive and genuine political aspects. Intuitively, respondents realise the societal nature of the respective problems and are reluctant to communicate exclusively in individualistic terms of modern utility theory. It is argued that no adverse consequences ensue from this finding when CVM results are practically applied for the sake of improving economic allocation. Nature conservation policy should be more oriented towards CVM results rather than depend on the influence of political pressure groups.",,,,,2003-12-05,52,8,2003,,Articles,ART,,7,Ulrich,Hampicke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,176_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Agrartechnologie zur Bekämpfung von Mikronährstoffmangel? Ein gesundheitsökonomischer Bewertungsansatz,en_US,"Micronutrient malnutrition is a serious problem in many developing countries. Recently, agricultural technologies have been discussed as a complement to other intervention programs. Plant breeding, targeted at developing staple foods with higher contents of essential vitamins and trace minerals, could benefit the poor in particular. Yet, the economic repercussions of such innovations are still unclear. Because traditional models of technology assessment are inappropriate to capture the specific ramifications, we suggest a health economics approach. Herein, micronutrient malnutrition is understood as a phenomenon that causes health costs through diseases and premature deaths. Details of the methodology are discussed within an ex ante study of Golden Rice in the Philippines. This technology promises to reduce vitamin A deficiency among the local population. Although it will not completely eliminate the problem, the expected benefits are sizeable. Depending on the underlying assumptions, internal rates of return on research investments range between 66 % and 133 %. This confirms that micronutrientdense staple crops can be an efficient way to reduce deficiency problems among the poor.

,Evaluierung der Erfolgsfaktoren des EFQM-Modells in der österreichischen Ernährungswirtschaft anhand des Analytischen Hierarchieprozesses,en_US,"Numerous companies in the Austrian food industry have already been certified in accordance with the ISO 9000 standards. However, the introduction of a quality management system in a company alone does not guarantee continuous improvement as required by the standard ÖNORM ISO 9001:2000. In order to be successful when introducing and maintaining a quality management system in a company, a number of important factors must be considered. These success factors are derived from the ""European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Model for Business Excellence"". The purpose of the EFQM Model is to support the internal assessment of the quality management within a company, and it can be regarded as a motor for internal improvement. In particular, for companies planning to introduce a quality management system it is very useful since it tells them which factors have to be taken into account even before they introduce the system. Basically, the EFQM defines a specific weighting of the 9 success factors of the model.

,Die Berücksichtigung von Unsicherheit und Flexibilität in der Investitionsplanung - dargestellt am Beispiel einer Vertragsinvestition für Roggen,en_US,"Investment decisions are, as a rule, characterized by uncertainty, irreversibility and flexibility. Simple net present value calculations will not account for these features. In many situations even flexible investment planning with decision trees, which represents the most advanced method of traditional investment appraisal, does not have the capacity to solve practical decision problems adequately. One handicap is a realistic and manageable representation of stochastic variables. It has long been known that stochastic simulation procedures offer a nearly unlimited capacity to represent distributions and stochastic processes. However, a standard simulation will not allow for the consideration of flexibility. The problem is that with a simple forward moving simulation of stochastic paths it is not clear at potential investment dates whether waiting or investing represents the optimal strategy. In this paper we show how stochastic simulation procedures can be integrated successfully into a backward recursive programming approach. The resulting modus operandi can be called ""Bounded Recursive Stochastic Simulation"" (BRSS). We use this efficient combination of simulation and dynamic programming to answer the question whether farmers should buy sales contracts which guarantee fixed prices for rye in the future. The results of the model affirm the importance of uncertainty and flexibility for investment decisions. They also show that the actual conditions offered by the wholesale buyer are not economically attractive for farmers, unless they are extremely risk averse. Thus, model results coincide with the empirical evidence that farmers do not enter these contracts.",,,,,2004-05-17,53,4,2004,,Articles,ART,,1,Oliver,Mußhoff,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,183_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,"Russia’s cereal markets: current trends, changes in net-trade position, and policy implications",en_US,"This paper provides an overview of the most recent developments on Russian cereal markets. A review of annual statistics on domestic production, trade, consumption, and storage of cereals reveals that the improvement in Russia’s net trade position cannot only be explained by increased productivity of grain producers. Exhausted storage capacities and lowered real trade costs after the devaluation of the Russian rouble in 1998 seem to have contributed to these developments. A computable general equilibrium model for Russia based on 1999 data was used for analyzing various economic developments and policy changes. The model simulations show that market protection in the short run, when the flexibility of labor and capital is restricted, may benefit Russian farmers. If, however, in the long run such structural rigidities can be abolished, a more liberal trade regime would also be positive for the domestic farm sector.",,,,,2004-05-17,53,4,2004,,Articles,ART,,3,Marc,Müller,Peter,Wehrheim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,184_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,A model-based approach to moral hazard in food chains - What contribution do principal-agent-models make to the understanding of food risks induced by opportunistic behaviour?,en_US,"Food risks may be caused by moral hazard, i.e. by opportunistic behaviour of upstream sellers who exploit the fact that many food product qualities remain uncertain to downstream buyers in the course of conventional market transactions (credence qualities). Due to this lack of market transparency buyers run the risk to pay premium prices for inferior products (quality risks); furthermore, they run the risk to use or consume substances which are harmful (health risks). Therefore, they will want to design optimal contracts and controls preventing opportunistic behaviour. Usually, however, buyers cannot contract contingent on the actions of upstream sellers because they cannot observe them directly (information asymmetry). Motivated by the obviously game-theoretic nature of the problem, we investigate the potential of principal-agent-models for the analysis of food risks induced by opportunistic behaviour. We identify a binary stochastic moral hazard model which is able to represent the microeconomic situation of buyers (principals) and sellers (agents) adequately. On the one hand, the model considers the remuneration costs which are needed to induce compliance. On the other hand, it accounts for direct costs and benefits of control as well as a limited traceability caused by the multiple agents setting of most food risk problems. If we know the costs of compliance, the stochastic relationship between the agent’s action and the product quality, and the traceability coefficient, we are able to determine the optimal control intensity and price for any cost of control function and predefined upper limit of the imposable sanction. For practical applications the main problem will be how to procure empirical data. The manageable data requirements of the binary model qualify it as a ready to use model for future applications: first, it can be used in positive analyses of food chains in order to detect the hot spots where food risks induced by opportunistic behaviour are to be expected for economic reasons. Secondly, it can be used in normative analyses in order to identify contractual designs which induce compliance at minimum costs. Thirdly, it can be used in order to compare the efficiency of different system structures taking into account the costs of change.",,,,,2004-06-17,53,5,2004,,Articles,ART,,2,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,186_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Der Wechsel vom konventionellen zum ökologischen Landbau: Eine investitionstheoretische Betrachtung,en_US,"The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of the real options approach for analyzing farmers’ choice to switch from conventional to organic farming. Understanding the determinants of this decision is relevant in particular for agricultural policy makers when predicting the response of farmers to support programs. After a brief review of the existing literature on barriers to the adoption of organic farming a theoretical model is presented that allows one to incorporate two main features of the adoption decision, namely irreversibility and uncertainty of the returns. The real options model quantifies investment multiples that trigger the adoption of organic farming. Compared with neoclassical models it suggests an inertia of the respective farming type, i.e. economic hysteresis. In order to find some empirical evidence for that hypothesis we utilize a switching regression model has originally been developed to test for market integration. The econometric model is then applied to aggregated data of conventional and organic farms in Germany and Austria spanning the period from 1982 until 2002. The empirical analysis confirms the reluctance to adopt organic farming due to option-like effects. We conclude that the incentives for adoption of organic farming (e.g. higher prices, direct payments or income stabilization) have to be increased if a higher share of this production type seems desirable.",,,,,2004-08-12,53,6,2004,,Articles,ART,,2,Martin,Odening,Oliver,Mußhoff,Volker,Utesch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,189_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Handels- und Budgeteffekte der WTO-Agrarverhandlungen in der Doha-Runde: Der revidierte Harbinson-Vorschlag,en_US,"A great deal of attention is currently being paid to the discussion of the reform of global agricultural trade. In this paper, the effects of the revised Harbinson paper (March 2003) are analysed with an extensively extended GTAP model. With the help of a base run, projections are implemented in the form of economic developments as well as already enacted EU policy reforms and measures (Agenda 2000, Mid-Term Review, EU enlargement, EBA agreement) from 1997 to 2014. The base run is compared with a scenario simulating the Doha Round of the WTO based on the revised draft of the Harbinson proposal. The difference between the base run and the model scenario provides information on the effects on EU trade and budget. The revised Harbinson paper leads to a particularly negative development in the trade balances and production quantities for the agricultural and food sectors of the EU-27, which are supported with high import duties, export subsidies and direct payments. Significant effects could be seen particularly in the cases processed food, beef, fruits and vegetables, other cereals and oils and fats. A decomposition of the total effects of the implementation of the Harbinson paper provides detailed insights in the effects resulting from the changes in the complex protection structure of the CAP. The implementation of the Doha Round of the WTO negotiations leads to a reduction in expenses for agricultural market policy of the CAP, caused especially by the production related reduction in direct payments and the complete dismantling of export subsidies.",,,,,2004-08-12,53,6,2004,,Articles,ART,,3,Martina,Brockmeier,Petra,Salamon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,190_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Optimierung unter Unsicherheit mit Hilfe stochastischer Simulation und Genetischer Algorithmen - dargestellt anhand der Optimierung des Produktionsprogramms eines Brandenburger Marktfruchtbetriebes -,en_US,"Optimization has been recognized as a powerful tool in teaching and research for a long time. In spite of its well known problem solving capacity, some methodological obstacles have persisted over the years. The main problem is that stochastic variables and their correlations cannot be adequately accounted for within traditional optimization procedures. In this paper, we develop a methodological mix of stochastic simulation and a heuristic optimization procedure which has become known as genetic algorithms. The simulation-part of the mix allows for the consideration of complex information such as stochastic processes; the genetic algorithms-part ensures that the method remains manageable in terms of required time and resources. We demonstrate the decision support potential of the approach by optimizing the production program of a Brandenburg crop farm. We account for the risky environment by using existing stochastic information: on the one hand, we model man-days which are available in critical seasons (particularly harvesting) as triangular distributions according to expert estimations. On the other hand, we use empirical time series and estimate stochastic processes for the gross margins of different activities (wheat, barley etc.). Additionally, variant calculations are made in order to take into account different risk attitudes of decision-makers. Model results in terms of optimal production programs and expected total gross margins are highly sensitive both to the risk attitudes of decision-makers and the stochastic processes which are estimated for different activities.",,,,,2004-09-13,53,7,2004,,Articles,ART,,3,Oliver,Mußhoff,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,192_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Marktintegration ohne Gemeinsame Agrarpolitik: Auswirkungen einer Einbeziehung von Agrarprodukten in die Zollunion mit der EU auf den türkischen Agrarsektor,en_US,"Turkey entered a customs union (CU) with the EU in January 1996. Agricultural trade is not covered by this CU but it is subject to extensive preferential trade rules. In this article, the effects of an inclusion of agricultural products in the CU as well as alternative policy options on the Turkish agricultural sector are analysed. To this aim, a comparative-static, partial equilibrium model of the Turkish agricultural sector is developed. The complete liberalization of the agricultural sector is found to lead to significant comparative static welfare gains of about Euro 670 million as compared to the the status quo. It appears that for most products, with few but significant exceptions, the inclusion of agriculture in the CU with the EU is very similar to the complete liberalization of agricultural trade.",,,,,2004-09-13,53,7,2004,,Articles,ART,,4,Harald,Grethe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,193_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Food quality, imperfect information and the role of markets and the state",en_US,"Measures of agricultural and food policy in industrialized countries are increasingly targeted at food quality. Regulation by governments to guarantee food safety are at the heart of the public debate. Public instruments of quality assurance are introduced on markets via certification and labelling. Public support for organic production or guaranteed regional origin shall provide quality signals for consumers. Arguments for consumer protection, such as the Precautionary Principle, are stressed but they may serve as a rationale for non-tariff barriers to agricultural and food trade, too. In addition to the public activities a large number of private initiatives for quality assurance does exist in the food industry. So far, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the policy measures directed at food quality, the private-sector quality assurance initiatives, and their interaction is not available. Such an analysis has to account for consumers’ incomplete information, uncertainty about food quality as well as consumers’ information behaviour. Given this background, this special issue shall contribute to a well-founded economic evaluation of the role of markets and the state in assuring food quality. The following collection of papers covers a variety of important issues relating to food quality, consumer behaviour and the role of markets and the government as regards food safety. Case studies refer to a number of industrialized countries, namely the European Union, the US, Japan and New Zealand. Despite the variety of topics and case studies discussed, it is a common feature of all papers that they have a methodological focus - either in theoretical or quantitative analysis or both. In that sense, the authors show convincingly that analytical economic research can be applied fruitfully to food-quality and food-safety issues in the future, as it has to price analysis and agricultural market policy in the past. The first paper, by Charles B. Moss, Troy G. Schmitz and Andrew Schmitz, is titled ""The brave new world: imperfect information, segregation costs, and genetically modified organisms"". It deals with genetically modified (GM) foods where consumer resistance has been particularly high, especially in Europe. In a microeconomic framework, the authors argue that consumers' willingness to pay for GM-free products will lead to a market segregation between GM and non-GM foods. Simulations with their model indicate that segregation costs and the magnitude of the supply shift are crucial for the economic impacts of market segregation. Moss, Schmitz and Schmitz elaborate those combinations of market segregation costs and increased supply due to the new technology under which the society’s welfare remains unchanged or improves. Adequate responses to food safety concerns among consumers are increasingly important for political and business strategies targeted at consumer information. The next two contributions investigate survey and experimental data which can provide valuable insights for designing such strategies. First, Jochen Hartl and John Fox address the issue of consumer acceptance of new technologies in ""Estimating the demand for risk reduction from foodborne pathogens through food irradiation"". Applying a double-bounded dichotomous choice model to data from a mail survey in eight US states, they investigate consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for reduced risk from foodborne pathogens. They find that the median WTP exceeds the additional cost of irradiation, but that the ""embedding effect"" is also present so that WTP only partially reflects the extent of risk reduction. In their analysis they also test for isolated and combined impacts of further individual characteristics and design factors, providing insight in various topical and methodological issues related to the demand for risk reduction in foods. So, despite the fairly restricted use of food irradiation in the EU, the European audience receives information that will be relevant for further developments and research. Second, Michele Graffeo, Lucia Savadori, Luigi Lombardi, Katya Tentori, Nicolao Bonini and Rino Rumiati present results from an experimental study in their paper on ""Trust and attitude in consumer food choices under risk"". With this contribution, the European experience of declining consumer trust due to various food safety crises is taken into consideration. The authors test with a structural-equation model for different hypothesized causal linkages between specific elements of attitude, antecedents of trust in the food chain system, and food choice as the dependent variable. Their analysis identifies two affect-based elements of trust and attitude, respectively, i.e. perceived shared values and food consumption as a positive experience, as key factors determining food choice in the context of a food scare. However, overall trust in the food chain system does not have a significant impact on participants’ choices, thus questioning attempts in the EU to generally regain consumer trust. ""Relating diet, demographics and lifestyle to increasing US obesity rates"" is the contribution of Christiane Schroeter. Obesity is linked to the quality and quantity of foods consumed and it has become a major threat to human health in industrialized countries. Schroeter analyzes data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) within a multivariate analysis to investigate how obesity can be explained with these cross-sectional data. A major result is that a number of dietary, demographic and lifestyle variables affect the body-mass index. The author cannot confirm, however, the causality often postulated between fast-food consumption and obesity. An interesting Californian case study is then presented by Henrich Brunke, Julian M. Alston, Richard S. Gray and Daniel M. Sumner: ""Industry-mandated testing to improve food safety: the new US marketing order for pistachios"". Food safety events in pistachios have occurred on several occasions since 1997 and in various countries, when aflatoxin levels were too high. Established as a US federal marketing order by the Californian pistachio industry, the new US marketing order for pistachios is a form of collective action. The marketing order contains standards and controls to reduce the likelihood of dangerous pistachios and further food safety events. The authors present simulations with a pistachio market model indicating that the net welfare effect of the new marketing order is in all cases positive. The marketing order, according to Brunke et al., raises the benefits of consumers and producers by guaranteeing a safer product. The following paper by Sayed H. Saghaian and Michael R. Reed analyses the ""Demand for quality-differentiated beef in Japan"", a country where consumers have very discriminating tastes and are willing to pay very high prices for high-quality food. This is clearly shown by large price differences between four origins, two domestic beef types plus imports from Australia and the US, reported by the authors for four different beef cuts. Based on a model of vertical product differentiation, Saghaian and Reed estimate an inverse demand system for each beef cut, which allows to capture non-price quality competition. Their analysis shows that Japanese consumers prefer domestically produced beef to imported beef and that quality-related substitution effects exist among the various origins. This paper clearly stresses the need for market analyses based on more detailed data, in particular for marketing applications. The final paper, by Mohammed Khaled, Vhari McWha and Ralph Lattimore, is titled ""Fragmenting markets and quality change in New Zealand foods: empirical analysis with a Rotterdam model"". The authors estimate a demand system, present a comprehensive set of food price and expenditure elasticities and analyze structural changes in New Zealand’s food demand over the last two decades. Various trends, like the increasing household consumption of fruits and vegetables, poultry and food away from home, are related to changes in consumers’ perspectives of food quality. Additionally, Khaled, McWha and Lattimore show that the consumption of major foods like fish, poultry, and meat or meals away from home have become more price elastic compared to earlier studies. The authors address this to increasing market fragmentation, i.e. the development of increasingly heterogeneous markets as a consequence of more differentiated consumer preferences. In general, the set of articles in this special issue covers many interesting topics and raises new questions. Therefore, we hope that the methodological approaches and the issues covered here will stimulate future economic research on food quality and food safety.",,,,,2004-11-01,53,8,2004,,Articles,ART,,1,Andreas,Böcker,Roland,Herrmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,195_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"The brave new world: imperfect information, segregation costs, and genetically modified organisms",en_US,"The introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops in the mid 1990s appeared to be the latest in a string of technological innovations in agriculture. However, consumer resistance, particularly in Europe has limited the sector’s enthusiasm. One response to the limited enthusiasm has been the emergence of segregated markets for GM and non-GM products. These separated markets reduce economic welfare because they require additional costs in the marketing system. Offsetting these segregation costs, however, the introduction of GM technologies offers increased economic welfare through reduced commodity prices for consumers who are indifferent to the presence of GM traits and increased profits to producers who adopt GM technologies. This study develops the combinations of segregation costs and increased supplies that leave societal surplus unchanged. Any GM technology that yields a larger increase in supply for any segregation cost depicted in this relationship meets the compensation principle and, thus, improves societal welfare. In this case, market based adoption of these technologies improve economic surplus. On the other hand, technologies that yields less increase in supply for any segregation cost reduces societal welfare. Under this scenario, market based adoption will not be welfare improving and, hence, government regulation may be required.",,,,,2004-11-01,53,8,2004,,Articles,ART,,2,Charles B.,Moss,Troy G.,Schmitz,Andrew,Schmitz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,196_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Estimating the demand for risk reduction from foodborne pathogens through food irradiation,en_US,"In this study the response of US consumers to irradiation in meat processing is examined. Despite scientific evidence of the effectiveness and safety of irradiation, meat processors and retailers have been slow to market irradiated beef products due to uncertainty about consumer acceptance. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the factors influencing consumer demand for irradiation using data from a contingent valuation (CV) survey with 819 households in eight midwestern US states. The analysis focused on the value of reduced risk from Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in ground beef consumption. Respondents were on average willing to pay a price premium of 22 cents/lb. for safer ground beef. Willingness to Pay (WTP) amounts were influenced by protective actions at home and varied partly with the scope of the risk reduction.",,,,,2004-11-01,53,8,2004,,Articles,ART,,3,Jochen,Hartl,John (Sean),Fox,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,197_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Trust and attitude in consumer food choices under risk,en_US,"In this paper, attitude and trust are studied in the context of a food scare (dioxin) with the aim of identifying the components of attitude and trust that significantly affect how purchases are determined. A revised version of the model by MAYER et al. (1995) was tested for two types of food: salmon and chicken. The final model for salmon shows that trust is significantly determined by perceived competence, perceived shared values, truthfulness of information and the experiential attitude (the feeling that consuming salmon is positive), but trust has no impact on behavioural intentions. Consumer preferences seem to be determined by a positive experiential attitude and the perception that breeders, sellers and institutions have values similar to those of the consumer. The model for chicken gave very similar results.",,,,,2004-11-01,53,8,2004,,Articles,ART,,4,Michele,Graffeo,Lucia,Savadori,Luigi,Lombardi,Katya,Tentori,Nicolao,Bonini,Rino,Rumiati,,,,,,,,,,,198_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Relating diet, demographics and lifestyle to increasing US obesity rates",en_US,"Changes in the American lifestyle are putting more individuals at risk due to the declining quality of their diets. In the last 20 years, the readily available high-fat foods (e.g., ""fast foods"") combined with the decreased caloric requirements due to lower physical activity levels is assumed to be the major factor in the sharp rise in the prevalence of obesity. The typical away-from-home meal is less healthy than food at home, since it tends to contain more total fat and saturated fat, less calcium, fiber, and iron, and fewer servings of fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, due to the super-sizing trend that is sweeping the market, when Americans eat out, they eat more. Thus, a rising away-from-home consumption appears to establish a significant barrier to improve American dietary habits and health status. The continuously increasing trend towards obesity is affecting the public health system tremendously, since four of the ten leading causes of death in the US, including heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes, are strongly associated with poor diet and physical inactivity. In terms of lost productivity and medical expenses, it leads to an estimated cost of $200 billion each year. Despite the considerable change in demographics and lifestyles, little research has documented the impact of changes in these factors on the rising US obesity. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of food source, diet, demographic, and lifestyle on the prevalence of obesity and overweight. This study will be based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 1999-2000), which, among many other variables, includes measured weight and height and hence provides the best opportunity to track trends in weight in the US NHANES, administered by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The NHANES provides nationally representative information on the health and nutritional status of the US population. While controlling for demographics, lifestyle and diet information, the main goal is to determine whether the source from which food is obtained also contributes to the increased overweight. Linear regression is applied to estimate the effect of food source, particularly fast-food outlets and restaurants, on the body mass index (BMI). BMI expressed as weight/height² (i.e. kg/m²), is commonly used to classify overweight (BMI: 25.0-29.9) and obesity (BMI: &gt;= 30.0) among adults (age 18 years and over). Previous studies have found gender-specific differences in the effect of different factors on the BMI. This is tested empirically in this study. Quantifying the effects of demographic and lifestyle determinants on BMI will provide a better understanding of the impact of different factors on obesity.",,,,,2004-11-01,53,8,2004,,Articles,ART,,5,Christiane,Schroeter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,200_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Industry-mandated testing to improve food safety: the new US marketing order for pistachios,en_US,"Food safety shocks can threaten the health of consumers, create havoc within an industry and result in severe losses to producers. Governments often attempt to aid food safety by mandating standards and inspection of food products to supplement the efforts by private firms and industries. This article assesses a form of collective action that falls between typical government mandates and purely private action. The California pistachio industry recently established a U.S. federal marketing order, which sets quality standards and inspection to reduce the likelihood of dangerous or poor quality pistachios. Simulation results indicate that, across the full range of parameters used in the analysis, the benefit-cost analysis was always favorable to the new policy. In the case of California pistachios, collective action is likely to be a helpful tool to ensure a safe product and increase benefits to producers and consumers.",,,,,2004-11-01,53,8,2004,,Articles,ART,,6,Henrich,Brunke,Julian M.,Alston,Richard S.,Gray,Daniel A.,Sumner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,202_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Fragmenting markets and quality change in New Zealand foods: empirical analysis with a Rotterdam model,en_US,"Very little is known about changes in the demand characteristics of food in New Zealand. As far as we can determine, there has never been a complete disaggregated food demand model estimated for New Zealand. The object of this paper is to update these estimates using more recent data to see whether there are grounds for believing that the structural changes that occurred primarily during the last two decades are having effects on the magnitude of food demand elasticities in New Zealand. To this end, a Rotterdam food demand system is estimated using time series data. The results indicate that over the last 20 years, household consumption has increased for fruit and vegetables, poultry, food eaten away from home, and sweet products, drinks and other foods. Fish, poultry, meat, farm products, cereals and meals away from home are all more price elastic than earlier estimates.",,,,,2004-11-01,53,8,2004,,Articles,ART,,8,Mohammed,Khaled,Vhari,McWha,Ralph,Lattimore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,207_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Branchenspezifische Besonderheiten im Innovationsver-halten des Ernährungsgewerbes: Eine empirische Analyse des Mannheimer Innovationspanels,en_US,"The article’s aim is to conduct a comparative cross-section analysis of the innovative behaviour of the German manufacturing industry. The peculiarities of the food industry are tested in a combined analysis based on both input and output indicators. Linear and logistic regressions are used to investigate the differences between the food industry and other branches of the manufacturing industry. In comparison to other branches, the food industry has lower research &amp; development (R&amp;D) expenditures whereas the import of research from more technology intensive sectors is high. Most of the released new products are improvements and imitations. Market novelties are rare. The development time for new products is relatively short compared to other industries, on average 8.5 months. A major part of innovations are imitated rapidly by competing firms, therefore the first mover advantages are low. Due to the low newness of innovations, marketing activities (e.g. advertising, labelling) are more important for new product introductions than in other industries. The regression analysis for the input indicators measured by the innovation intensity shows that the innovative behaviour of food companies significantly deviates from other manufacturing sectors. However, the logistic regression analysis of the output indicators doesn’t confirm these results. The dummy variable of the food companies has no significant impact on the output indicators. Firms in the food industry might embark on imitation and product modification strategies. Therefore, they realize an average innovation output without spending the same amount of money as the other industries. In addition, it can be confirmed that small enterprises of the German manufacturing industry have a higher innovation activity in terms of both innovation input and output. The impact of business expectations on input and output indicators is significantly positive. An international orientation measured by the ratio of exports to firm sales leads to a higher probability of introducing new products and novelties.",,,,,2005-02-24,54,2,2005,,Articles,ART,,1,Sabine,Kubitzki,Sven,Anders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,224_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

Therefore, the article presents selected results of preference measurement (conjoint-analysis) with special regard to different food production modes (organic production, conventional production and production reflecting animal welfare aspects) and labelling of food origin (out of the region, from farm-gate and without labelling of the food origin). The empirical research shows surprising results: the organic produce is not as strongly preferred as the product alternative reflecting the animal welfare aspect. As a consequence, marketing-strategies should pay much more attention to animal welfare aspects, whereas organic production seems to be a less persuasive promotion argument.

,Ökologischer Landbau in Nordrhein-Westfalen: Empirische Analyse und Bestimmungsgründe der heterogenen räumlichen Verteilung,en_US,"In North-Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), the most populated German state (18 million people), 2.6% of the agricultural area is farmed organically (as of 1.1.2002). Using data derived from the NRW statistical office, the statewide extension agencies and organic farmers’ organisations, the geographical distribution of the organic farms was investigated by correlating general conditions and the economic and natural environment. The organically farmed area varied widely - from 0.1 to 7.5% of total agricultural area - over the 34 administrative districts of NRW. The focus of this study is an analysis of the agricultural structure to understand the heterogeneous distribution of organic farms in NRW. In certain parts of NRW, highly specialised intensive farming creates a high environmental burden. Although organic agriculture clearly has a lower negative environmental impact, the number of organic farms in regions with specialised intensive production is low. The inherent needs of these specialised intensive systems restrict the options to simplify and to adopt organic farming systems, and some products (e.g., pork, sugar beet) only have access to a very small organic market. Therefore, the opportunity for increasing the rate of transition (conversion) of specialised conventional farms to organic farming is very limited within the current agro-political framework. The analysis of the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the organic farms illustrates the need for a different supporting payment system for organic areas. In addition, measures supporting organic farming should not be restricted to financial support.",,,,,2005-02-24,54,2,2005,,Articles,ART,,3,Guido,Haas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,226_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Turkey’s accession to the EU: what will the Common Agricultural Policy cost?,en_US,"At the EU Council in December 2004, European heads of governments decided to start EU accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005. Various recent analyses assess the cost of applying the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU (CAP) to Turkey; most of them without taking into account the specific structure of the agricultural sector in Turkey, which would determine the receipts from EU funds. This paper assesses potential budgetary effects resulting from the application of the CAP to Turkey. The analysis is based on macroeconomic projections, equilibrium modelling of the Turkish agricultural sector, and projections of the future development of the CAP. It is found that total EU budgetary outlays for the application of the CAP to Turkey could total about Euro 3.5 billion in 2015 and rise to Euro 5.4 billion in 2025 due to full phasing in of direct payments and rural development policies. The resulting net transfer under the CAP to Turkey would be about Euro 1.7 billion in 2015 and could increase to Euro 2.9 billion in 2025. Such sums take a backseat to projected transfers under the structural policy of the EU and the overall political project of including Turkey in the EU.",,,,,2005-02-24,54,2,2005,,Articles,ART,,5,Harald,Grethe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,227_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Reform der EU-Milchmarktpolitik bei instabilen Weltmärkten,en_US,"The article examines the market and welfare effects of the current CAP reform and further policy options on the EU dairy market. The main focus is the influence of unstable world markets and the uncertainty it generates in policy analysis which has been widely neglected. The simulations of a stochastic dairy market model reveal that the considered policy options affect the impact of world market instabilities on the EU dairy market. Thus, not only a changing level of producer price or revenues can be expected, but also a changing degree of instability. Policy making without taking such instability changes into account may lead to undesired effects and, finally, could undermine the realisation of policy objectives. Also, the evaluation of the welfare effects of the policy options is more sophisticated than in a deterministic examination. With respect to the assessment of the CAP reform the simulations show that its impact on the EU dairy market instability as well as on the uncertainty of the welfare effects depends crucially on whether the quota is binding or not.",,,,,2005-04-05,54,3,2005,,Articles,ART,,2,Michael,Grams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,231_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Wetterderivate: Ein Instrument im Risikomanagement für die Landwirtschaft?,en_US,"The risks associated with farming activities are likely to increase in the future. It, therefore, appears worthwhile to analyse new risk management instruments. This paper investigates weather derivatives for which a market has already emerged in the USA. Contrary to traditional financial derivatives, their payoff is determined by future weather events, such as temperature or precipitation. Thus, they hedge risks which result from climate. Since they address production risks they are complementary to instruments that hedge price risks, such as future markets. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the economic impacts of weather derivatives and to assess their potential as farm level instruments of risk management. After outlining the main characteristics and the functioning of weather derivatives and their emergence, emphasis is placed on model calculations to quantify farm level impacts. The potato farm is used as a case study. Empirical data on yields and weather variables are taken from an experiment station of the Chamber of Agriculture at Hanover, Germany. After studying the relationship between yields and weather variables, the findings are used to design an option based on a precipitation index. Stochastic simulation is then used to assess the effects on the probability distribution of revenues. The results show that weather derivatives can be useful instruments of risk management in agriculture. Since there is still a lack of knowledge with respect to some of their economic impacts, further research is needed. This refers to the choice of suitable commodities and weather indexes, the contractual design and methodological aspects of pricing and of integrating weather derivatives into the risk management of farms. Last but not least, the question has to be answered, as to which partners would be willing to accept the risk that farmers intend to reduce by means of weather derivatives.",,,,,2005-04-05,54,3,2005,,Articles,ART,,3,Ernst,Berg,Bernhard,Schmitz,Michael,Starp,Hermann,Trenkel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,233_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Übermäßige Werbung und Marktsegmentierung durch staatliche Förderung der Regionalvermarktung: Eine theoretische Analyse,en_US,"The protection of the regional origin of foods is a major part of the food-quality policy in the EU. It is the objective of this article to analyze economic effects of such policy instruments. Two different types of policy are distinguished which are both designed to promote regional products. First, generic promotion of a homogeneous commodity at the national and/or regional level in the spirit of NERLOVE and WAUGH is investigated. This instrument aims at shifting the demand for the advertised commodity outward. We derive theoretically that excessive advertising does exist if several promotion activities at different regional levels exist at one time. It would be more cost-effective due to product substitutability to move from separate strategies at the level of states to a coordinated uniform generic promotion. Secondly, there is support in the EU for regional-origin labels which combine quality assurance with the regional label. Product heterogeneity arises here when regional products reach above-average quality and prices increase. A segmented market model is utilized to show that the price bonus is affected by the magnitude of promotion expenditures, by own - and cross-price advertising elasticities on the markets and by marginal costs of program participation.",,,,,2005-04-05,54,3,2005,,Articles,ART,,4,Roland,Herrmann,Sven,Anders,Stanley,Thompson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,234_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Zur Bewertung von Wetterderivaten als innovative Risikomanagementinstrumente in der Landwirtschaft,en_US,"The importance of weather as a production factor in agriculture is well established long time and a significant portion of yield fluctuations is caused by weather risks. Traditionally, farmers have tried to hedge against unfavorable weather using insurance, such as crop insurance. In recent years a new class of instruments, so called weather derivatives, have emerged. They allows to reduce weather based risks as well. Weather derivatives are financial market products such as forwards, futures, options and swaps, that have a weather component such as temperature or rainfall. Although weather derivatives have some advantages compared to traditional insurance, their trading volume is still rather small. One reason (among others) for why potential users hesitate to enter the market are the difficulties to determine a fair price for these products. Financial pricing methods such as the Black-Scholes formula cannot be directly applied since weather is not a tradable asset. In this article, various pricing methods are investigated and applied to actual weather data. One important finding is that there are considerable differences between the pricing methods. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of the pricing methods and give some recommendations for their application. Our results may be relevant not only for producers but also for potential sellers of weather derivatives.",,,,,2005-06-07,54,4,2005,,Articles,ART,,1,Oliver,Mußhoff,Martin,Odening,Wie,Xu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,239_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Interregionale Disparitäten und Entwicklung ländlicher Räume als regionalpolitische Herausforderung für die neuen EU-Mitgliedstaaten,en_US,"Since the beginning of transition, interregional disparities in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) have increased. Particularly, the differences between urban and rural areas have grown. This paper traces the development of these disparities and discusses, based on theoretical considerations and political objectives, the need for and the design of regional policy measures. For rural development in the new EU member states, institution building, competitiveness of the agri-food sector, non-farm income sources and labour mobility are crucial. These measures should be adapted to the specific characteristics of the respective areas. Since the end of the 1990's, the efforts of regional policy in the CEECs were highly influenced by the preparation for EU-accession. The SAPARD programme has strengthened institutional mechanisms and capacity building.

,Zahlungsbereitschaften für Frischmilch aus der Region: Ergebnisse einer Kontingenten Bewertung und einer experimentellen Untersuchung,en_US,"In this paper we present the results of a contingent valuation study and an experimental approach to estimating the willingness to pay for fresh milk produced in the consumer's own region. In contrast to the fictitious contingent valuation study, responses in the experimental investigation are connected with real demand decisions and real financial payoffs in an incentive-compatible way. The experimental setup allows to quantify the bias in stated willingness to pay that results from the contingent valuation’s hypothetical character. In essence, the data suggest that there exists a considerable demand for milk from the consumers` home region. Yet, significantly less demand is found in the experimental investigation. At the same time, subjects accept significantly higher mark-ups for regional provenance of ecologically produced milk compared to regional provenance of conventionally produced milk. However, the convex shape of aggregate demand indicates that there is a substantial demand for fresh milk of the consumers` home region only when mark-ups are fairly low.",,,,,2005-07-05,54,5,2005,,Articles,ART,,2,Carsten,Schröder,Henrike,Burchadi,Holger,Thiele,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,243_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

Trade preferences for agricultural goods which are granted under these agreements as well as under former arrangements are analyzed by calculating the value of preference margins at several stages in the evolution of preferences. The total value of preference margins for all countries covered was about EURO 130 million under the agreements in the mid-seventies and increased by 48 per cent until 1995. It was eroded by about 14 per cent until 2000 due to the reduction of EU MFN tariffs. The extended preferences under the new agreements more than compensate for this erosion of preferences and result in a total value of preference margins of EURO 226 million once all agreements have entered into force.,,,,,2005-10-21,54,7,2005,,Articles,ART,,2,Harald,Grethe,Stephan,Nolte,Stefan,Tangermann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,256_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

A literature review reveals that various simulation models uniformly project a decline of the cereal and silage maize acreage as well as ruminant production in the EU-15 in the course of decoupling of direct payments. In contrast, model results are mixed with respect to the direction of the decoupling effect on oilseed and pasture as well as voluntary set aside area. The model type is not found to have a systematic effect on model results. It is rather the assumptions about the effects of direct payments on production which differ widely and drive model results to a large extent.

,Zur Entwicklung der Hauswirtschaften im Verlaufe des Transformationsprozesses in der Ukraine,en_US,"In the course of transition, the role of household plots in agricultural production in Ukraine has grown substantially in importance. The key reason for this is the integration of household plots into large agricultural enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the economic efficiency of household plots. In addition, the paper aims at testing whether economic theory is able to explain the behaviour of households in this regard. Two important characteristics in the evolution of household plots’ in Ukraine have been identified. One is the integration of household plots into large agricultural enterprises. This improves the efficiency of these plots through access to inputs. The other is that about 22.4 % of household plots farmers, who also worked in the large agricultural enterprises are planning to expand their operation. Although the theories presented in the paper greatly contribute to the explanation of household plots’ behaviour, more research must be done to better explain the reasons for households’ economic acti-vity.",,,,,2006-03-02,55,2,2006,,Articles,ART,,1,Andriy,Nedoborovskyy,Eberhard,Schulze,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,221_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Wie viel bringt eine verbesserte Produktionsprogrammplanung auf der Grundlage einer systematischen Auswertung empirischer Zeitreihen? – Die Bedeutung von Prognosemodellen ...,en_US,"In this paper we examine whether there is room for improvement in farm program decisions through the integration of formal mathematical optimisation into the planning process. Probing the potential for improvement, we investigate the cases of four Brandenburg cash crop farms over the last six years. We find that their total gross margins could have been increased significantly through a more sophisticated program planning. However, we also find that the superiority of formalised planning approaches depends on the quality of the data. The superior formal planning approach includes, in contrast to farmers’ ad hoc planning, a systematic time series analysis of gross margins and a stochastic optimisation model. For each of the six years, the formal planning approach provides optimised alternative programs based on the information available to the farmers at the respective time of planning. In order to avoid solutions that exceed the farmers’ risk tolerance, the variance of the observed program’s total gross margin which implicitly reflects the risk attitude of the individual farmer is used as an upper bound in the optimisation. Using the yields and prices realised at the end of each planning period, the total gross margins that could have been realised through the formally optimised programs in each year are then compared to those that were actually realised.",,,,,2006-05-19,55,4,2006,,Articles,ART,,1,Oliver,Mußhoff,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,236_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Optimale Vertragsdifferenzierung in der Agrarumweltpolitik,en_US,"This article deals with the optimal differentiation of agri-environmental contracts based on a self-selection mechanism. The paper demonstrates that both economic efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures can be increased, if a menu of combinations of farming practices and payments are offered. However, there is a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, since the optimal programme minimising government expenses does not simultaneously minimise farmers’ opportunity costs. A numerical example of differentiated agri-environmental contracts, aiming for the reduction of nitrogen fertiliser in wheat production, illustrates that efficiency and effectiveness gains can be substantial. Furthermore, it is shown that economic rents for agricultural producers do not necessarily shrink as a result of contract differentiation, if the latter aims for the minimisation of public expenditures.",,,,,2006-05-19,55,4,2006,,Articles,ART,,2,Thilo,Glebe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,238_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Potentieller Beitrag der Landwirtschaft zur Verminderung der Treibhausgasemissionen in Deutschland,en_US,"In 2002, the German agricultural sector contributed 8.7 % of the total national green house gas emissions. The main sources were animal digestion, manure management and agricultural soils. From the technical point of view, the manure management has the biggest potential of green house gas reduction by using biogas technology. Thereby methane emission from manure, which otherwise had been emitted into the atmosphere, can be recaptured and used to substitute fossil fuels. Regarding the whole output of manure from cattle and swine in Germany, the emission reduction is 56 Mio. t CO2-equivalent. This amount is equivalent to 4.5% of the emissions in 1990/95 for the Kyoto protocol. Regarding the biomass potential which is technically feasible at the moment, the reduction potential growth to 276 Mio. t CO2-equivalent or 22% of emissions.

,Land use under changing economic and political conditions – consequences of the CAP reform –,en_US,"The spatial distribution of land use systems is determined by the physical, economic, political, institutional and technological environment. For land users this environment constitutes a set of exogenous variables. They try to optimally adapt their production programmes and land use intensities to this set of variables consistent with their economic objectives. Changing values of these exogenous variables thus trigger adjustments and may lead to changing regional land use patterns. Recent reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP Reform) have dramatically altered the conditions under which land use decisions are made. Decoupling, cross-compliance and modulation will have a major influence on decisions for both, farmers and politicians. Expected changes in regional land use patterns and production intensities will not only affect regional production and agricultural income, but also other landscape functions such as the diversity of flora and fauna, recreational value, groundwater recharge etc. Although the implementation process of the new policy will take several years, some effects are expected to materialize rather soon. At present, empirical evidence is still insufficient. Nevertheless, decision support is needed - for farmers to meet the new challenges and for politicians because a review of the Common Agricultural Policy has been scheduled for 2009. “Land use modelling”, however, means more than just generating aggregate information on key variables such as value added, employment etc. In addition, it should provide quantitative forecasts of future land use patterns. Thus, appropriate modelling methods are employed to produce spatially explicit information. In many cases model results have been displayed in the form of maps which exhibit potential land use distributions of the regions under investigation. For this issue researchers in the field of land use modelling were invited to present their research on the expected changes of regional land use patterns and landscape functions under the conditions of the CAP Reform. The authors were asked to do both, analyze methodological aspects and present results of their models. The complexity of the problems have often required more than one researcher to be involved in the model building and application process, especially if two or more models needed to be interlinked. Under the common topic of “Land Use Changes”, the papers presented in this special issue cover a wide range of questions in detail. The most outstanding difference is the modelling scale. Starting from BRITZ et al., covering the entire European Union, the scale descends to the single farm approach, presented by SCHRIJVER et al. Within these boundaries, a multitude of scales are modelled and investigated. As a consequence, some model results include statements on the multifunctionality arising from certain land use patterns. The applied methodology is mainly Linear Programming and extensions adapted to the nature of the considered problem. However, the challenge of spatially explicit modelling may require other approaches, as e.g. WEINMANN et al. discuss. BRITZ et al. present an enhanced version of the non-linear programming model CAPRI which covers the European Union, subdivided into 250 regions. The model is designed to predict the regional effects of the reformed CAP on land use distribution, as well as on commodity supply. In order to achieve endogeneity of product prices, the supply component of CAPRI is linked to a global multi commodity market model. KÜPKER et al. present an analysis of expected consequences of the CAP reform by looking at the EU member states Germany and France. They apply the non-linear farm group optimization model EU-FARMIS which is based on farm level data. The expected consequences of the different reform implementation options, adopted by the two member states, are investigated on aggregate level, as well as for specific farming systems. KUHLMAN et al. investigate at the national scale of the Netherlands, how farmers’ behaviour are likely to change in reaction to the new regulations. Probable changes in land use patterns are generated for two different scenarios by linking a macro-economic model, an agricultural sector model and a land use model via the so-called “land use scanner”. The multi-model approach is employed to ensure spatially explicit forecasts of land use systems which result from macro-economic and sectoral effects of the CAP Reform. WEINMANN et al. apply the model ProLand, a spatially explicit land use model, using a different methodology to calculate future land use patterns. Site specific crop yields are treated as endogenous variables depending on site specific non-controllable growth factors, such as the available water (precipitation, usable field capacity) and solar energy (temperature sums). The land use projections can also be used as small-scale inputs to ecological and hydrological models, exploring the consequences for biodiversity and water balance. ROEDER et al. discuss if and how the individual behaviour of farmers can be integrated into a regionally differentiated Linear Programming model, by using the example of three typical grassland regions in southern Bavaria, Germany. The model aims at maximizing the utility of individual land users. A land market model is embedded into the linear optimization model. HAPPE et al. combine the models AgriPoliS and MODAM to generate responses of selected, heterogeneous farms to changes in direct payments. Associated impacts on the production of non-commodity outputs within a competitive and dynamic environment are also considered. Finally SCHRIJVER et al. deal with the single farm model FIONA, looking at management options for dairy farms under a new Dutch agricultural policy instrument called “Farming for Nature”. Under this scheme no external inputs to the farm are allowed. Similar to the approaches by WEINMANN et al. and HAPPE et al., FIONA also generates quantitative information on multifunctionality indicators of farming systems. In sum, this special issue provides a broad but certainly still incomplete overview of the state of the art in the field of model building and expected land use changes in the year zero of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy. Numerous scales and methodological approaches are considered and employed. Obviously, there will be no single all encompassing model for the time being. Various “stand alone” models have to be used, as well as combinations of several models. The editors of this special issue of “Agrarwirtschaft” – the German Journal of Agricultural Economics – hope that the contributions will trigger a fruitful discussion to the benefit of the scientific community and, for that matter, also to the advantage of the respective “consumers” in the field of modelling, and predicting land use changes and their economic and ecological consequences under a changing policy regime.",,,,,2006-07-20,55,5-6,2006,,Articles,ART,,1,Friedrich,Kuhlmann,Detlev,Möller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,244_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Effects of decoupling on land use: an EU wide, regionally differentiated analysis",en_US,"This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the impacts of the „Luxembourg Compromise” as compared to a continuation of Agenda 2000 to the year 2010. The employed new version of the CAPRI model allows us to represent the different member states’ implementations of the CAP reform and to reflect endogenous world market prices based upon a spatial global trade model. The specific contribution of the analysis is a detailed look at the impacts of national differences in the CAP implementation and regional production structures with respect to changes in land allocation. At EU level, cereal areas decrease by about 5% and oilseeds by about 3%. This is paralleled by increases in the set-aside acreage and extensive fodder production. However, significant differences at the regional level can be observed. They are caused mainly by differences in the shares of durum wheat and fodder maize.",,,,,2006-07-20,55,5-6,2006,,Articles,ART,,2,Wolfgang,Britz,Thomas,Heckelei,Ignacio,Pérez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,246_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Assessing impacts of CAP reform in France and Germany,en_US,"The 2003 CAP Reform left EU member states much room for national implementation. The farm group model EU-FARMIS is applied to quantify the effects of the reform and the impacts of the options for national implementation. The analysis is done for France and Germany because their implementation schemes adequately reflect the broad range of options. It is found that cereal and fodder maize production is reduced both in France and Germany. In contrast, the acreage of other arable fodder crops, of set-aside and of non-food crops is expanded. While bull fattening is substantially reduced in both countries, suckler cow production is extended in France due to partial decoupling, but reduced in Germany due to full decoupling. Sectoral income effects measured in Farm Net Value Added are similar.

,Future land-use change in the Netherlands: an analysis based on a chain of models,en_US,"Analyses of the impact of European policies on agricultural change are most often based on agricultural sector models. Such models have their limitations: they cannot specify the interaction between agriculture and the rest of the economy, and their spatial dimension is usually limited. Land use simulation models, on the other hand, usually depend on other models for assessing the demand for land. The consistency of those models with the assumptions and databases of the land use model is often not examined. This article reports on a research project where the links between a macro-economic model, an agricultural sector model and a land use model were explicitly explored in order to arrive at a consistent model chain. This integrated framework was put to the test by applying it to two contrasting scenarios, which compare impact on agricultural incomes, land use and land management.",,,,,2006-07-20,55,5-6,2006,,Articles,ART,,4,Tom,Kuhlman,Frank,van Tongeren,John,Helming,Andrzej,Tabeau,Aris,Gaaff,Rolf,Groeneveld,Boudewijn,Koole,David,Verhoog,Jasper,Dekkers,,,,,249_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Simulating the effects of decoupled transfer payments using the land use model ProLand,en_US,"This paper describes the bio-economic land use model ProLand and presents selected results for scenarios of coupled and fully decoupled Pillar One transfer payments under the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The basic assumption for the model is that land users select the land use alternative from a set of agricultural and silvicultural land use systems which is expected to generate the highest possible land rent. The model is used to estimate effects of fully decoupled transfer payments on land use in a less favoured region in Hesse, Germany. The results confirm that the CAP Reform removes the distorting effects of coupled transfer payments. The extent and direction of land use changes are spatially variant. Overall, the CAP Reform will lead to increases of permanent grassland area at the cost of arable land. The total agricultural land rent generated in the region will grow substantially, mainly due to higher amounts of transfer payments.",,,,,2006-07-20,55,5-6,2006,,Articles,ART,,5,Bernd,Weinmann,Jan Ole,Schroers,Patrick,Sheridan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,252_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Impact of the CAP reform on small-scale grassland regions,en_US,"This paper presents a regional land-use model that conceives farms as independent agents aiming at maximum individual utility. Farm agents optimize their utility with the help of a linear-programming algorithm that takes into account natural, economic and personal restrictions. Interactions between farms take place on the land market, which is modelled as an equilibrium market. The model is applied in three typical grassland regions in southern Bavaria. The results indicate that the CAP reform of 2003 has various significant consequences for grassland use. In particular, the decreasing profitability of dairy farming will lead to low-intensity forms of grassland use, including mulching. In general, land rents will increase due to the effects of decoupling.",,,,,2006-07-20,55,5-6,2006,,Articles,ART,,6,Norbert,Roeder,Jochen,Kantelhardt,Martin,Kapfer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,253_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,CAP-reform and the provision of non-commodity outputs in Brandenburg,en_US,"This paper presents an attempt to model the response of selected farms to decoupled direct payments and the associated impact on the provision of a defined set of non-commodity outputs (NCO’s) using a combined modelling approach consisting of the AgriPoliS and MODAM models. AgriPoliS focuses on the socio-economic dimension of multifunctionality at the individual farm and regional levels and explicitly models heterogeneous farms (in size, location and efficiency) within a competitive and dynamic environment. The linear-programming model MODAM allows a detailed representation of production processes and their impact on the environmental dimension of multifunctionality at the farm level. We simulate the impact of a uniform area payment and a fully decoupled single farm payment. Our case study region is the district Ostprignitz-Ruppin in Brandenburg. Results show that the decoupling schemes create a trade-off between the NCO’s and that adjustment reactions differ between farms depending on their legal form, size, and production.",,,,,2006-07-20,55,5-6,2006,,Articles,ART,,7,Kathrin,Happe,Martin,Damgaard,Amanda,Osuch,Claudia,Sattler,Peter,Zander,Sandra,Uthes,Johannes,Schuler,Annette,Piorr,,,,,,,255_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Development of nature-oriented dairy farm systems with an optimization model: the case of ‘Farming for Nature’ in ‘de Langstraat’, the Netherlands",en_US,"‘Farming for Nature’, a relatively new policy instrument being tried out in the Netherlands, is evaluated. The concept has been designed to allow dairy farmers to improve nature conservation on their farms. Under the scheme, no manure, fertilizer, or feed - concentrates or roughage - may be imported into farm systems from external sources. The feasibility of such a self-sustaining system and the conditions required for it to deliver the desired results, are explored with a farm-based linear programming model known as FIONA (Farm based Integrated Optimization Model for Nature and Agriculture). The model is explained and applied to ‘de Langstraat’, a region in southern Netherlands. The results show that levels of production under the ‘Farming for Nature’ regime are dependent upon soil fertility and the proportion of land that is suitable for growing arable crops. If all available land on a dairy farm in the scheme is arable land, then high production levels of up to 7,500 kg milk per hectare can be realized. If only 30% of the farm area is suitable for arable crops, then only lower production levels, of about 6,600 kg milk per hectare can be realized. The scheme has positive ecological effects.Both nature and cultural landscape values may benefit significantly from the concept. Improvement in ecological terms however, carries a price in terms of agricultural income. An average dairy farm adopting the concept of ‘Farming for Nature’ experiences an income loss of approximately € 840 per hectare in the short-run (5-10 years). More important is the observation that the scale of such farms in the short-run might be too small to earn an attractive income for its workers, even when fully compensated according to European Union regulations.",,,,,2006-07-20,55,5-6,2006,,Articles,ART,,8,R.A.M.,Schrijver,P.B.M.,Berentsen,R.A.,Groeneveld,A.,Corporaal,T.J.,de Koeijer,,,,,,,,,,,,,257_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

The nucleus of this reform has been the transformation of the agricultural and food policy from a producer centred perspective of agriculture to a more market and consumer oriented food chain approach. Such a systemic perspective calls for a stronger and systematic integration of the more demand-oriented policy fields of food, consumer and public health policy as well as of elements of politics of sustainable development along the whole food chain.

,Do the Scandinavian consumers pay a ‘fair’ price for premium German white wines?,en_US,"The aim of this paper is to analyse the retail prices of premium German white wines sold in the Scandinavian countries. German white wines account for approximately 5-6 per cent of the total sale of wines – both red and white wines - in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. However, the market shares of German wines in Scandinavia have been declining for a number of years. Diminishing market shares may reflect changes in consumer taste or simply ‘wrong’ prices, the latter related to both the level of wine prices (German wines being relatively expensive) and the structure of wine prices. In general, country-specific price differences for identical wines may be caused by differences in taxes, different import prices, transportation costs as well as other costs - and also different competitive conditions at the retail level in the respective countries. Still, differences in wine prices across countries do not always reflect the above mentioned factors. The aim of this paper is to analyse further the relationship between the prices of German white wines in the Scandinavian countries and the prices in the country of production (Germany) by direct comparison (price level) and by using a hedonic price function approach (price structure). Using a sample of 150 German white wines being supplied on at least one of the national markets in Scandinavia the analyses suggest that the prices on German premium white wines on the Scandinavian markets are fair – both in terms of absolute average prices and in terms of relative prices.",,,,,2006-11-21,55,8,2006,,Articles,ART,,4,Jan,Bentzen,Valdemar,Smith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,267_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

Farmers are also increasingly requested to implement quality systems. This paper gives an overview of quality regimes in the agro-food sector and compares three systems in the domains of pork production, potato growing and the cultivation of hop. 315 Bavarian farmers were interviewed in order to identify factors which may influence the satisfaction with quality systems. Differences between the three quality regimes were moderate with respect to the overall satisfaction. Hop growers judged their system to improve production efficiency while the others did not to this extent. Socio-demographic factors do not have any significant impact on farmers' satisfaction with the quality systems. Key factors are gains in image, in sales and in production efficiency.

The model is validated by a dataset from a survey among potential farm successors. It can partly be confirmed.

Additionally, in exploring the BTA relevant process standard rules laid out by the WTO, the analysis indicates the extensive flexibility provided in this framework. This leads to larger scope for national polices on process standards compared to product standards (e.g. residua levels). The empirical trade flow analysis illustrates differences in the compliance costs between countries. This differentiation can be caused by learning costs that may differ among countries.

,Integrating ecological and economic aspects in land use concepts for agricultural landscapes,en_US,"Especially in environmentally sensitive agricultural landscapes, agriculture cannot define its aims by itself - it has to account for a number of demands of different groups of society. For example, agriculture is expected to produce food and at the same time contribute to the protection of cultural landscapes and to further ecological services. Land use concepts for ecologically particularly sensitive agricultural landscapes are often focussed on the attainment of specific environmental objectives in specific areas, neglecting both socio-economic effects, in particular income effects, and the farmers' income-driven production responses outside these areas. The paper illustrates, on the basis of an empirical study, (1) that the farmers' objectives and production responses need to be integrated in land use concepts for agricultural landscapes because of their potentially counterproductive effects on the attainment of environmental objectives, and (2) how multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be used to transform a primarily ecology-oriented concept for an ecologically very sensitive agricultural landscape into a more comprehensive one that makes due allowance for the farmers’ responses and society's socio-economic objectives. The authors show that the integration of socio-economic objectives can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological goals. Finally, the paper discusses policy implications resulting from the implementation of land use concepts for agricultural landscapes, in particular in the field of agri-environmental policy, and raises some practical issues that come up if policy makers apply MCDA more widely in the design of such concepts.",,,,,2007-04-04,56,3,2007,,Articles,ART,,4,Heinz,Ahrens,Jochen,Kantelhardt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,278_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Empirische Untersuchungen zum optimalen Spezialisierungsgrad ökologisch wirtschaftender Marktfruchtbetriebe,en_US,"This paper employs the concept of technology efficiency to analyse the optimal degree of specialisation of organic arable farms. Based on bookkeeping data from 461 organic farms, three technology specific frontiers (each representing a different degree of specialisation) and an all-encompassing metafrontier are estimated using a combination of Data Envelopment Analysis and Window Analysis. The results indicate that a significant proportion of sample farms have not chosen their optimal degree of specialisation. We quantify the potential productivity gain from switching to the optimal specialisation class. This is highest for moderately specialised farms switching to higher degrees of specialisation. We demonstrate that there are significant differences in the structure of inputs and outputs between farms that have chosen the optimal degree of specialisation and those that have not.

,Künftige Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Milchproduktion im Berggebiet Österreichs und der Schweiz,en_US,"The mountain areas of Austria and Switzerland are important locations for dairy farming. Owing to natural conditions, the milk in these areas is produced at a considerably higher cost. Nevertheless, structural change in the mountain areas of both countries proceeded at a lower pace than in the plain areas. Milk production in the mountain area of Austria was appreciably expanded. This paper presents a number of attempts to explain these regional shifts, analysing the competitiveness of the farms, as well as the alternatives outside of milk production in the mountain and plain areas of Austria and Switzerland. In addition, we investigate whether milk production in these regions is also capable of holding its ground under future conditions. The on-average lower opportunity costs for land and labour in mountain areas are largely responsible for the high perseverance of dairy farmers in these regions. Common to both countries, however, is the fact that the competitiveness of farms in mountain areas can only be guaranteed by high direct payments. The extent of these direct payments is appreciably higher in Switzerland than in Austria, owing to the expected alignment of Swiss and EU milk prices, and the higher wage level in Switzerland. The high national economic importance of mountain milk production with regard to tourism and decentralised settlement explains the broad social acceptance of these payments, which should be less affected by cutbacks than other agricultural subsidies.",,,,,2007-05-16,56,4,2007,,Articles,ART,,3,Leopold,Kirner,Christian,Gazzarin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,281_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Economics and agricultural market impacts of growing biofuel production,en_US,"This paper analyses the economics of biofuel production and the implications that the accelerating growth in biofuel production in many countries could have on agricultural markets. It shows that production costs of ethanol and biodiesel differ significantly across countries and feedstock crops. These costs often exceed those of fossil fuels. In consequence, the economics of biofuel production depends on public support in most countries. Similarly, land requirements for crops required to enable significant shares of biofuel production in transport fuel consumption are shown to be substantial in many countries given current technologies. An expected growth in biofuel production is, therefore, likely to have a significant increasing impact on world prices for sugar, cereals and oilseeds beyond what is caused by higher crude oil prices alone. The paper points out a number of policy issues that require attention and further analysis to facilitate a fuller discussion of biofuel policies.",,,,,2007-07-03,56,5-6,2007,,Articles,ART,,7,Martin,von Lampe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,284_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Analyse des verbraucherorientierten Qualitätsurteils mittels assoziativer Verfahren am Beispiel von Schweinefleisch und Kartoffeln,en_US,Consumers’ quality judgement depends on their knowledge concerning certain quality attributes. Against this background this paper presents the results of a consumer survey conducted in 2004. We focus on measuring consumers’ cognitive structures regarding pork and potatoes. On this account we apply a free-association technique and a variation of concept mapping. Our analysis shows that consumers’ cognitive structures are quite complex and heterogeneous. Product characteristics such as ‘taste’ and ‘fat content’ dominate consumers’ knowledge. To predict the eating quality of pork consumers prefer intrinsic quality cues. In contrast to that extrinsic quality cues are used to predict the origin of the given product. With regard to potatoes the intrinsic quality cue ‘appearance’ as well as the extrinsic quality cue ‘kind’ are used to predict the palatability. This knowledge enables marketers to invent consumer-oriented marketing activities.,,,,,2007-10-08,56,7,2007,,Articles,ART,,2,Maike,Bruhn,Carola,Grebitus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,292_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Unter welchen Umständen würden deutsche Landwirte gentechnisch veränderten Raps anbauen? Ein Discrete-Choice-Experiment,en_US,"We examine the factors affecting the willingness of German farmers to adopt genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape after the pending commercial release of GM varieties. The analysis is based mainly on a web-based Discrete Choice Experiment with 217 oilseed rape growers in Germany. The determinants of adoption were estimated with the use of a multinomial probit model. Results indicate a significant impact of economic determinants on the adoption willingness: the difference in gross margins between GM and conventional rape, the probability and level of liability for damage caused by cross-pollination, and the length of the waiting period before a farmer can return to conventional rape are all highly significant. Among the farm characteristics, farm size increases the willingness to adopt, while the share of oilseed rape grown has a negative impact. Two social factors decrease the willingness to adopt: negative attitude of neighbouring farmers towards GM oilseed rape and whether at least one of the farmer’s children is younger than 16. Personal characteristics such as degree of innovativeness and the level of education increase the willingness to grow GM rape, while the existence (or otherwise) of a successor, farmer’s age, and his or her degree of cooperativeness are not significant. For a successful market launch of GM oilseed rape, our findings suggest the need to identify strategies for farmers to minimize cross-pollination. A successful market launch should thus not only rely on the availability of profitable GM varieties; it should rather be complemented by a communication offensive to influence farmers’ attitude towards genetic engineering, as well as the provision of technical advice as to how cross pollination can be kept to a minimum.",,,,,2007-10-08,56,7,2007,,Articles,ART,,3,Gunnar,Breustedt,Jörg,Müller-Scheeßel,Henrika,Meyer-Schatz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,293_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Distortions in a multi-level co-financing system: the case of the agri-environmental programme of Saxony-Anhalt,en_US,In this paper we analyse the impact of the EU multi-level co-financing system on regional policy-making and priority setting taking the case of the agri-environmental programme of Saxony-Anhalt. The implications of several co-financing scenarios are analysed and compared to respective lump-sum transfers using an interactive linear programming approach. The results reveal how regional choices on agri-environmental measures are influenced by the co-financing system leading to distortions. The extent of these distortions depends on the specific regional preferences and restrictions.,,,,,2007-10-08,56,7,2007,,Articles,ART,,4,Dieter,Kirschke,Astrid,Häger,Kurt,Jechlitschka,Stefan,Wegener,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,291_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Mehr-Ebenen-Modelle in der Analyse agrarstruktureller Entwicklungen – Methodik und Implikationen,en_US,"Until now empirical analyses have not succeeded in the determination of a general upon agreed bunch of the most important driving forces of structural change in agriculture beyond the level of the national economy. It will be argued that the sometimes contradictory results of different studies are caused by the endogenous dynamics of structural change as well as by mixing up different levels of causality. The influence of single causes, therefore, is not necessarily characterised by linearity, symmetry and independence of other causes, of the location or of time. Multi-level-models are being presented as a method with the capability to cope with these problems by modelling hierarchical relations and dynamics in time simultaneously. The flexibility of the method as well as its capability to generate new insights will be demonstrated on the example of a panel analysis for the explanation of regional differences in structural change of agriculture.",,,,,2007-11-16,56,8,2007,,Articles,ART,,2,Anne,Margarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,295_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Opt-in of the agricultural sector to the European trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions – a proposal and its possible effects,en_US,"In light of international discussions on a possible opt-in of the agricultural sector to the current European emission trading system for greenhouse gases, the objective of this article is to present a feasible implementation strategy for a market of emission permits in European agriculture and to simulate its economic effects within the regionalised agricultural sector model CAPRI. With this purpose, we compare the effects of a 15% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from European agriculture with and without a trading scheme. Our findings suggest that if significant emission abatement is to be achieved in the agricultural sector, efficiency gains from expanding the current emission trading scheme to this sector can be appreciable. An additional finding of this paper is that under the current protective measures in the CAP and in the absence of a successful WTO reform round, emission reduction does not result in a net income loss for the agricultural sector due to the ‘quota effect’ caused by the isolation of European agricultural markets from world markets.",,,,,2007-11-16,56,8,2007,,Articles,ART,,3,Ignacio,Perez,Karin,Holm-Mueller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,296_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Im Dschungel der Importzölle – Die Bedeutung der verwendeten Methodik bei der Aggregation von Importzöllen –,en_US,"The results of liberalization studies can be influenced decisively by the methodology of import tariff aggregation. This article deals with different measures used to aggregate import tariffs. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of different aggregation measures are discussed theoretically. In the empirical part of the paper, the simple average and the trade-weighted average of bound and applied tariffs are calculated for different agricultural products of the EU. The analysis considers ad valorem and specific tariffs as well as tariff rate quotas. Additionally, for the applied tariffs, a distinction is made between MFN-tariffs and bilateral preferential tariff rates. Using the same data base, the product specific Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI) and the Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index (MTRI) are calculated. Because of the poor data availability at the detailed tariff-line level, a simple partial equilibrium application of these indices is implemented, which can be extended to the whole import tariff data base of an economic trade model. The results show a strong correlation between all aggregation methods, but the size of the import tariffs differs highly, depending on the aggregation measure used. Furthermore, high differences between bound and applied tariffs for some EU agricultural products are calculated.",,,,,2008-02-20,57,2,2008,,Articles,ART,,2,Janine,Pelikan,Martina,Brockmeier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,298_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Nutrition and health claims – call for and justification of governmental intervention from the consumers’ perspective,en_US,"In December 2006 the Regulation (EC) No. 1924/2006 on the use of nutrition and health claims (NHCs) on foods was enacted in order to prevent consumer deception and to harmonise law within the EU. Against this background, this paper analyses the potential costs and benefits linked with NHCs and the necessity for governmental intervention to regulate NHCs within a theoretical and empirical framework. The theoretical investigation shows that NHCs can induce direct economic effects as well as spillover effects in the market of information. Whether those effects are beneficial or adverse depends on the truthfulness of the NHCs, and consumers’ perception and processing of such claims. As self regulatory forces of the market might not be sufficient to prevent market failure due to fraudulent claims, governmental intervention seems necessary. An analysis of the EU Regulation on NHCs reveals that this law focuses on preventing the authorisation of false or misleading claims. It is less concerned with not authorising a true and correctly understood claim. The results of the empirical analysis which is based on a standardised consumer survey reveal that the stated impact of NHCs on product perception considerably differs among consumers. While e.g. some consumers feel misled by NHCs on products with a negative nutrient profile such as candies, others point out that such claims have no impact on their product perception or even help them to make better choices. The results also indicate that the great majority of consumers is opposed to a ban of NHCs on products with a negative nutrient profile such as candies and salt.",,,,,2008-02-20,57,2,2008,,Articles,ART,,3,Monika,Hartmann,Anne Katrin,Lensch,Johannes,Simons,Sylvia,Thrams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,299_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Die WTO-Verhandlungen und die GAP,en_US,"Over the last decades the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been increasingly influenced by the WTO negotiations. The MacSharry-Reform and the Mid Term Review (MTR) reform of the CAP for example improved the conformity between the EU agricultural policy and the liberalization requirements on the international level. Currently, it is again discussed within the Health Check how the EU direct payments will be adapted to meet the international and national requirements. This paper employs the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Model to quantify the global and national effects of the implementation of the current WTO negotiations and the adaptation of the EU direct payments. The impact of the change in the respective political instruments and the exemption of sensible products are calculated with the help of two policy scenarios and a decomposition and set in relation to each other. This procedure shows that the cut of agricultural tariffs is of considerable importance for almost all commodities in all countries and regions. In contrast, the adaptation of the EU direct payments is only of greater importance for the EU itself.",,,,,2008-04-08,57,3-4,2008,,Articles,ART,,1,Martina,Brockmeier,Janine,Pelikan,Rainer,Klepper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,302_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Die Logik der europäischen Agrarpolitik: Politische Macht oder ökonomische Gesetzmäßigkeiten?,en_US,"This paper derives an applied general political economy model incorporating a model of political decision-making into a computable general economic equilibrium model. Political decision-making among a set of legislators is modeled via a mean voter decision rule derived from a modified non-cooperative legislative bargaining game of a BARON-FEREJOHN type. Legislators’ preferences are endogenously derived from political support maximization, where policies translate into legislators’ support according to a political transformation surface. Each surface reflects specific economic framework conditions of legislators' constituency. The model allows a simultaneous analysis of political and economic factors determining policy outcome. In regard to the Health Check proposal of the Commission the model is applied to simulate future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) under various political and economic scenarios. Main results are: (i) MTR-reform will not be stable in the future. In particular, EU-enlargement and technical progress imply further reforms in 2013 corresponding to further liberalization of CAP and a further shift towards the second pillar, i.e. from market &amp; price to structural policies. (ii) These general trends would be attenuated by increased world market prices, while additional WTO restriction would amplify these trends. (iii) Compared to economic and international policy factors, constitutional reforms, e.g. a higher participation of the European Parliament in CAP decision-making, have only moderate impact on future CAP, while changed financial rules would significantly reverse policy trends, i.e. reallocating budget from the second to the first pillar.",,,,,2008-04-08,57,3-4,2008,,Articles,ART,,2,Christian H.C.A.,Henning,Carsten,Struve,Martina,Brockmeier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,303_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Modellgestützte Abschätzung der regionalen landwirtschaftlichen Landnutzung und Produktion in Deutschland vor dem Hintergrund der „Gesundheitsüberprüfung“ der GAP,en_US,"The framework conditions surrounding agricultural production in Germany have changed dramatically due to the Renewable Energy Law (EEG) and a sustained increase in agricultural prices. The Common Agricultural Policy, substantially reformed in the Luxemburg Compromise, will be considered in the framework of the “Health Check”. Against this background, the regional developments anticipated in dairy production, beef cattle husbandry and agricultural land use by the year 2015 are analysed with the help of the regionalized agricultural sector model RAUMIS. Simulations on the adaptability of dairy production under different market conditions are carried out with regard to the expiration of the dairy quota regulation. The farming intensity on arable land is generally increasing due to the increase in agricultural prices, the elimination of set aside obligation and the promotion of renewable resource crops. The increasing competitiveness of cash crops is speeding the departure of dairy production from arable crop areas into competitive grassland regions. In contrast, milk production is either constant or reduced on less competitive grassland locations. Among the regions reducing production are, according to the model results, low mountain ranges with high levels of grassland, for example in the Black Forest, in the Schwäbisch Alp, in the Hessian Mountain area in parts of the Eifel and parts of the Hunsrück. In the course of the many decades of milk quota system, a significant milk production potential was deactivated which could play a large role when the quota regulations expire. Based on a calculated “milk equilibrium price” at which the quota amounts are exactly produced, a price increase of ten percent leads to a long term expansion of the milk produced by about six million tons. There is thus no reversal of the successive milk production reductions in the least competitive regions, not even through significantly higher direct payments distributed in the framework of the introduction of the “regional model” in grassland regions, since these are decoupled payments. Should this drop in milk production have negative consequences for other sectors, for example tourism, it is to question, whether specific measures should be developed for the affected regions.",,,,,2008-04-08,57,3-4,2008,,Articles,ART,,3,Peter,Kreins,Horst,Gömann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,304_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Evaluierung von Agrarumweltprogrammen auf Grundlage der Umwelteffizienz landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe,en_US,"This paper sets out to develop an economic framework for ex post evaluations of agri-environmental schemes. We begin by developing a non-parametric model for estimating farm-level environmental efficiency scores. We then use this efficiency framework to devise a set of economic criteria for evaluating agri-environmental schemes. One key criterion is whether an environmental scheme has given rise to an increase in environmental efficiency scores across participating farms, relative to a counterfactual group of non participants. We finally demonstrate the potential usefulness of the framework by applying it to a fictitious multiple-objective conservation programme. The dataset is made up of 100 fictitious farms, half of which participate in the environmental programme. Each farm is characterised by a set of financial and environmental performance indicators. The results of this mock evaluation show that the proposed evaluation framework generates useful insights into the performance of the scheme and permits identification of potential improvements.",,,,,2008-04-08,57,3-4,2008,,Articles,ART,,4,Tammo,Francksen,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,306_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Future of European agriculture after the Health Check,en_US,"This paper identifies major future trends and driving factors and perspectives and challenges resulting from them for European agriculture and food sectors until the year 2020. The focus of the paper is an analysis of key driving forces and the provision of a well developed reference scenario under the assumption of continued CAP reform and taking into account the framework discussions in the Doha Development Round. To assess the impact of policies the paper also examines a liberalisation (no support) and regionalisation (maximum support) scenario. In terms of policy options the paper shows that the structural change process in agriculture (measured in terms of agricultural share in GDP) is a long-term process that continues with or without policy changes. The EU is facing an increasing diversity of structure and structural adjustment. The livestock sector (especially cattle) faces important challenges and restructuring. Alternative policy settings may not produce very different effect on the overall production as factor markets adjust. However, the regional impact on the environment and on the number of farms may prove to be more significant.",,,,,2008-04-08,57,3-4,2008,,Articles,ART,,5,Martin,Banse,John,Helming,Peter,Nowicki,Hans,van Meijl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,301_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"The influence of climate change, technological progress and political change on agricultural land use: calculated scenarios for the Upper Danube catchment area",en_US,"Both climate and agricultural policy changes are commonly seen as important drivers for agricultural production. In this study, scena-rios of climate and political change were calculated for the Upper Danube catchment area using the regional optimization model ACRE. Two political scenarios were calculated for the year 2020. One scenario assumes the continuation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform 2003 the other assumes a strong shift away from payments of the first pillar to payments of the second pillar of the CAP. Both scenarios were combined with four different scenarios of climate change and technological progress derived from ICCP SRES assumptions and the ACCELERATES project. The results of the scenario calculations were analysed with respect to their implica-tions for the whole catchment area as well as for selected districts. Climate change and technological progress both cause small changes in agricultural land use: fodder crop area tends to be converted to cash crop area, and intensive grasslands tend to be converted into extensive grasslands. Climate change and technological progress increase crop productivity, and consequently, total gross margin increases. The impact of climate change might get stronger toward the end of the century which is beyond the scope of the investigations presented here. The impact of climate change might thus switch from bringing net benefits in the short to medium term to bringing net losses for the area investigated in the long run.",,,,,2008-04-08,57,3-4,2008,,Articles,ART,,6,Martin,Henseler,Alexander,Wirsig,Tatjana,Krimly,Stephan,Dabbert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,305_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Elastizitäten der Nachfrage privater Haushalte nach Nahrungsmitteln – Schätzung eines AIDS auf Basis der Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe 2003,en_US,"This paper presents price and income elasticities of food demand in Germany. Using cross sectional data from the 2003 German income and consumption survey a Linear Approximate Almost Ideal Demand System is employed. Two aspects which have to be taken into account when using cross-sectional data are insufficient price information and zero expenditures. An approach of COX and WOHLGENANT (1986) is applied to derive quality adjusted prices. In order to take into account censoring of the dependent variables a procedure of SHONKWILER and YEN (1999) was employed. A high expenditure elasticity is found for meat demand. The highest own-price elasticities are for the demand for meat/-products and milk/-products. Within the meat group, beef demand shows a particular low own-price elasticity. The cross-price elasticities indicate more complementary relationships than was expected. Elasticity analyses differentiated by household groups suggest that elasticities for meat differ between these groups.",,,,,2008-05-08,57,5,2008,,Articles,ART,,2,Silke,Thiele,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,309_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Hedging von Mengenrisiken in der Landwirtschaft – Wie teuer dürfen „ineffektive“ Wetterderivate sein?,en_US,"Since the mid-nineties, agricultural economists discuss the suitability of “weather derivatives” as hedging instruments for volumetric risks in agriculture. Contrary to traditional insurance contracts, the payoffs of such derivatives are linked to weather indices (e.g. accumulated rainfall or temperature over a certain period) that are measured objectively at a defined meteorological station. While weather derivatives thus circumvent the problem of moral hazard and adverse selection, weather derivative markets for the agricultural sector are still in their infancy all-over the world. Some economists attribute this to theoretical valuation problems and the lack of a pricing method which is accepted by all market participants. Others think that the low hedging effectiveness of (standardized and non-customized) weather contracts cripple the market. Motivated by the question of how weather derivatives should be priced to agricultural firms, this paper describes a risk programming model which can be used to determine farmers’ willingness-to-pay (demand function) for weather derivatives. The model considers both the derivative’s farm-specific risk reduction capacity and the individual farmer’s risk acceptance. Applying it to the exemplary case of a Brandenburg farm reveals that even a highly standardized contract which is based on the accumulated rainfall at the capital’s meteorological station in Berlin-Tempelhof generates a relevant willingness-to-pay. We find that a potential underwriter could even add a loading on the actuarially fair price that exceeds the loading level of traditional insurances. Since transaction costs are low compared to insurance contracts, this indicates that there may be a significant trading potential.",,,,,2008-05-08,57,5,2008,,Articles,ART,,3,Oliver,Mußhoff,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,310_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Öffentliche Wahrnehmung der Primärverantwortung für Lebensmittelsicherheit: Eine Medienanalyse der Gammelfleischskandale,en_US,"At the beginning of the year 2005 the German meat industry frequently appeared in the media with reports about rotten meat. Since then a huge number of new problems with meat have arisen which have disclosed weaknesses in food quality control and highlighted the extremely sensitive nature of the subject in the meat sector. Contrary to the BSE crisis after which private control systems were strengthened, the ""rotten meat scandals"" led to more state control. Hence, no clear political direction is perceptible as to whether primary responsibility for food safety should lie with the state or with the industry. The following contribution examines this question with regard to the presentation of this subject in the media. It is based on the content analysis of 347 articles on the topic ""rotten meat"" which were published in seven German newspapers. The empirical results demonstrate that state actors have dominated the debate in the media and have thus decisively contributed to the fact that the primary responsibility for food security in Germany is assigned to the government.

,Key issues of linking models for policy impact assessment in agriculture,en_US,"Model-based quantitative assessment of agricultural and trade policy options has a long tradition in Europe. The attendance and presentations of related EAAE seminars (BAUER and HENRICHSMEYER, 1989; HECKELEI et al., 2001; ARFINI, 2005; BARTOVA and M'BAREK, 2008) highlight the dynamic developments in this area and the continuously growing importance of model analyses as a basis for policy consultation. Though linking models is far from a new idea, recent years have seen a massive increase in the design and application of linked model systems, often supported by international networks and/or large (national or multinational) research projects. The proliferation of linked modelling is both demand and supply driven. On the one hand, the complex challenges European agricultural policy is facing in view of far reaching reforms (decoupling, liberalisation) and new areas of concern (climate changes, limited (energy) resources and food security) in a globalised world have increased the demand for corresponding comprehensive analyses. On the other hand, the ‘boom’ of linked modelling is also driven by the possibilities offered by the ongoing developments of powerful hardware and efficient software. The obvious advantages of linking models for policy analysis compared to single model approaches - e.g. increased coverage, improved consistency of scenarios - are accompanied by a number of challenges: Theoretical consistency is a key issue from a scientific viewpoint, and open questions arise in particular when linking models with different individual theoretical foundations, or when linking models covering different levels or scales. The optimal ‘degree’ of the linkage is as much a methodological as a philosophical question, and depends on the objectives of the model system and team and the specific application. While full automation of model linkages improves consistency and reproducibility of the output from complex model systems, soft coupling, where feedback between models passes a ‘human interface’, stresses the didactic value of a diversity of approaches with possibly different model outcomes. Practical and technical issues of the communication between models often dominate the daily work in linked model systems. Different definitions (‘a cow is not a cow’), units, concepts, data sources and software, constitute time-consuming obstacles to efficient and consistent model linkages. The problems are frequently aggravated when linking models from different disciplines. The establishment and, even more so, the sustainable maintenance of linked model systems is an institutional challenge. The successful long-term organisation of an effective co-operation of different modelling teams needs to provide sufficient financial and/or human resources as well as deal with incentive problems. In addition to securing long-term financial resources, a key problem is the fluctuation of temporary personnel, which in particular affects universities but is also relevant at many other institutions. Linked model systems involve considerable costs for the scientists involved, as maintenance of the linked system is time-consuming and may reduce the flexibility for model development. It is therefore essential that clear measurable benefits from model linkage exist for all team members. The more people and institutions are involved, the higher is also the necessity for formal rules with respect to property rights and benefit sharing. A specific issue relevant for the scientific community here relates to the publication of peer-reviewed papers. Difficult to publish anyway (see below), the incentive for a publication based on linked model analysis may be further reduced with the need to include a high number of authors (see, e.g., VAN ITTERSUM et. al., 2008: 15 authors; PARKER et al., 2002: 45 authors). Communication of results from linked model systems poses a challenge in itself. The huge amount of information generated and the often high number of models involved require a condensation which frequently creates a ‘black box’ problem. Publication in scientific journals is often difficult if not impossible, as length restrictions for articles make it difficult to present a model theoretical background for several models at the same time. For policy consulting, the (perceived) lack of transparency of complex multi-model systems often reduces acceptance of related results. Communication to policy makers is particularly challenging when individual model results differ: while model differences are often seen as a source for new insights in academic settings, policy makers generally require consistency in findings and messages, and appropriate care has to be taken to tailor presentation and explanations to the respective target group. Communication within the model group is quite another, often underestimated challenge, especially if the members of the groups come from different disciplines, as concepts and (meaning of) terminology often differ. Due to those and other challenges, there is no universal approach for successfully linking models for policy impact assessment. Strategies to deal with the numerous challenges depend, among others, on the specific institutional setting, the objectives of the analysis and the individual team preferences. The papers presented in this issue discuss in-depth selected aspects of linking models, and provide examples of successfully dealing with the highlighted challenges under different conditions based on extensive experience of the respective authors. The articles from BRITZ and from HELMING and BANSE revolve around methodological aspects of linking models. BRITZ discusses different types of model linking and illustrates these with examples from the CAPRI system. Specific attention is paid to more formalised approaches ensuring consistency across models. HELMING and BANSE draw on the extensive experience of LEI with linking models at different scales. They discuss the benefits and challenges faced when models are loosely linked, and highlight the importance of human resource development for the sustainable maintenance of model groups. Institutional issues are at the core of the following two papers. SALAMON et al. discuss the challenges of establishing a large European network combining individual national models into one single model. They specifically also discuss the organisational and technical requirements and tools necessary to cope with the high number of institutions involved. DOMINGUEZ et al. describe the integration of several well-established economic models in a modelling platform for agro-economic policy analysis on the premises of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Seville. Communication to the two main target groups for model-based policy assessments are the topic of the last two contributions. Based on the experiences of the vTI model group, BROCKMEIER et al. discuss the many challenges and pitfalls in policy advice based on linked models, and identify strategies to overcome these. Their paper points specifically to the importance of the establishment of close and reflective linkages between modellers and policy makers. BURRELL contrasts these requirements to those posed by the scientific community. Drawing on her long experience as both a modeller and editor of the European Review of Agricultural Economics, she discusses the circumstances under which linked model studies can form the basis of peer-reviewed journal articles and provides some guidelines, which many model builders will find particularly helpful. While surely not covering all aspects that arise in the field of linked modelling, the papers in this issue span a wide range from theoretical and methodological to institutional and issues of communication. The authors all draw on extensive experience in the field of linked modelling, and many of the lessons learned were ‘learned the hard way’. However, it is interesting and promising to also observe an increasing professionalisation, where insights and solutions from other disciplines, e.g., management, computer or communication sciences, are transferred and adapted to facilitate large-scale linked model systems.

,Automated model linkages: the example of CAPRI,en_US,"Increasing demand for policy impact assessment regarding social, economic and environmental aspects asks for combined application of different models and tools. The paper discusses concepts and challenges in linking models, taking CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact) model as an example. CAPRI combines different economic models, spatial downscaling and interfaces to bio-physical components. 250 non-linear regional programming models with econometrically estimated costs functions cover the EU-27, Norway and Western Balkans. They are consistently linked to a spatial globally closed trade model, covering 60 countries / country blocks and 50 primary and secondary agricultural products. The link is based on sequential calibration: the market models prices drive the programming models whereas its supply and feed demand curves are calibrated to the programming models’ results, iteratively repeated to convergence. CAPRI integrates projection results from other model systems in the baseline generation and calibrates the supply models to econometric estimations or the supply response from other models as in SEAMLESS. The spatial down-scaling component breaks down the regional EU-27 results regarding cropping shares, crop yields, animal stocking densities and fertilizer application rates to about 140 000 1x1 km pixel cluster and links these results to a statistical meta model of the bio-physical model DNDC.",,,,,2008-11-21,57,8,2008,,Articles,ART,,2,Wolfgang,Britz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,319_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The didactic value of linking models: experiences from the LEI model funnel,en_US,"The complexity of agri-environmental economic issues is such that a model that is fully consistent at all levels of aggregation and all type of questions to be addressed is not available at the Agricultural Economics Research Institute in the Hague LEI. Such a model is probably also not feasible. At LEI this problem is solved by linking models at different scales of analysis: global economic, national economy-wide, regional agricultural, national spatial and farm levels. This linked model system enlarges scope and consistency of the analysis. The goal of the model linking, however, is not a full integration and, ultimately, simultaneous optimization of the models. Therefore, the different models of the LEI model funnel are often rather loosely linked. Hence, it is not surprising that the models sometimes produce different results even for the shared variables. This article describes the difficulties to share and exchange information between different models and identifies possible solutions which aim at a more consistent analysis along the models combined at LEI while maintaining the diversity of modelling approaches.",,,,,2008-11-21,57,8,2008,,Articles,ART,,3,John F.M.,Helming,Martin,Banse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,320_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,How to deal with the challenges of linking a large number of individual national models: the case of the AGMEMOD Partnership,en_US,"The AGMEMOD Partnership seeks to capture the inherent existing heterogeneity of agricultural systems by linking together individual EU Member State models, an aggregated EU model and several accession countries into one single model, while still maintaining analytical consistency. Although this approach facilitates the comparison of the impact of a policy change across different Member States, it generates challenges in practical implementation, ranging from significant communication and administration requirements, to aggregation and consistency issues. This contribution provides insights into the different challenges posed to the scientists and discusses the key issues for maintenance and further development of such a complex system.

,The challenges of model based policy advice,en_US,"In policy consultation, communicating model results to administration and policy makers has always proven to be a challenge for scientists. Many of the relevant preconditions for effective and successful policy advice are aggravated when results are based on the simultaneous use of a multitude of different models. This paper identifies key issues - e.g., relations to administration; correct identification of prevailing objectives of all agents involved; ability to run scenarios ‘in time’ - and discusses strategies for successful communication based on the experiences of the vTI model network. Specific attention is paid to the issue of communicating ‘conflicting’ results of different models: while often seen as a source for scientific insight, such ‘inconsistencies’ have proven to be a major obstacle for acceptance in a non-academic institutional setting. The experiences, as well as the literature, point specifically to the importance of tight linkages between modellers and policy makers, and the need to abandon decisionist or technocratic approaches of policy advice in favour of pragmatic approaches stressing the bilateral nature of communication.",,,,,2008-11-21,57,8,2008,,Articles,ART,,6,Martina,Brockmeier,Werner,Kleinhanss,Frank,Offermann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,323_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Zusatznutzen Berg? Argumente für den Konsum von Bergprodukten,en_US,"Given the broad range of products in food retailing, actors are increasingly aiming to differentiate their products by promoting certain features as added benefits. This means that any added (emotional) benefit, whichever way it is communicated, becomes significant. In this article we investigate inhowfar the fact that a product originates from a mountain region constitutes such an added benefit for consumers and what arguments support their choice of mountain food products. We present results of four focus groups with participants from Austria (Tyrol) and Germany, analysed by using Convention Theory. Our findings suggest that the origin of a food product in a mountain region does not constitute a singular added benefit but rather the sum of several components associated with a mountain origin, in varying combinations, depending on the specific focus group. The statements gathered in the focus groups may thus provide some indication on how to improve the communication strategy for mountain products.",,,,,2009-02-19,58,2,2009,,Articles,ART,,2,Anja,Matscher,Markus,Schermer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,327_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Bei welchen Problemstrukturen sind Data-Envelopment-Analysen sinnvoll? Eine kritische Würdigung,en_US,"Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is widely used to compare the empirical performance of decision making units such as firms or public bodies. With a view to the recent boom of applications to a very wide range of different problems, this paper shows for which data and problem structures DEA represents an appropriate analytical tool for generating knowledge. The paper stresses the point that an efficiency analysis such as DEA which does not use prices to weigh different inputs and outputs is, first of all, adequate if several input and/or output prices are unknown or if they cannot be ""trusted"" to reveal the relative scarcity of resources and goods. In all other circumstances, stand-alone DEA generates less knowledge than standard approaches which resort to classical economic performance criteria that measure the resources used (inputs) and the goods and services produced (outputs) in monetary units. If prices are known, DEA is only useful if it is used as an additional tool to decompose economic performance weaknesses into a technical component (mismanagement of technological processes) and allocative components (maladjustments to prices on the factor and product markets).",,,,,2009-02-19,58,2,2009,,Articles,ART,,3,Oliver,Mußhoff,Norbert,Hirschauer,Michael,Herink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,326_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Zur Akzeptanz von gentechnisch verändertem Saatgut in der deutschen Landwirtschaft,en_US,"The use of genetically modified seeds is a controversially discussed topic. Regardless of the increased global significance - in 2006 genetically modified (GM) seeds were used on 102 billion hectares - GM seeds have almost no importance in German agriculture. However, the market introduction of Bt-corn is in its first stage. This article analyses attitudes and intentions of German farmers. The results are based on a survey of 370 German farmers which own larger structured farms in the northwest of Germany. The sample shows no clear rejection of GM seeds. A structural equation model reveals important parameters influencing the attitude and intention concerning green genetic engineering. The attitude may be explained by the acceptance within the social environment (family, village community) and by the assessment of the economic advantages. The planned behaviour is mainly influenced by the general attitude towards genetic engineering, the economic environment and by the social environment.",,,,,2009-04-08,58,3,2009,,Articles,ART,,2,Julian,Voss,Ulrich,Spiller,Ulrich,Enneking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,330_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Determinanten der Zeitverwendung für Ernährung in Deutschland: eine ökonometrische Analyse mit Zeitbudgetdaten,en_US,"Time budget data describe how much time people invest in different activities of a daily routine. The study presents contributions of time budget data to the nutrition research on the example of German Time Budget Surveys 1991/92 and 2001/02 of the German Statistical Office. Over time, mothers reduced the amount of time spent on food preparation. Tobit analysis reveals that time inputs in cooking, baking and laying the table are influenced by personal as well as household-specific characteristics and especially by intra-family allocation of time. Fathers increase their participation in food preparation as time invested in their own jobs decreases and their partner’s degree of employment increases. The decomposition of Tobit coefficients, following the MCDONALD/MOFFITT procedure, is discussed. The study reveals how time budget data can contribute to household economic research in an innovative way. Although time budget data do not unveil quality and quantitiy of the food in family households, the results of the study demonstrate the importance of institutionally organised nutrition education in kindergarten and school.",,,,,2009-04-08,58,3,2009,,Articles,ART,,3,Anke,Möser,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,331_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Fraud and free riding in tropical forests - on the potential for certification to enforce sustainable resource use indirectly,en_US,"Certification schemes for forest products are understood by many as a way to promote sustainable resource use when it is impossible to rely on direct enforcement of process standards. Based on the concept of ‘Self-Enforcing Contracts’, this study develops a market model that simulates the simultaneous partial equilibrium for both certified wood units and physically identical units that are produced without observing certain ecological standards. By illustrating the interplay of supply and demand in a world characterised by incomplete information, opportunistic behaviour and free riding, the model simulations, along with some empirical evidence from tropical forestry, indicate that certification will very likely fall short of preventing degradation of tropical forests. This is especially true in politically and economically unstable situations. Consequently, institutions other than markets are needed to govern the way natural resources are used. The problem of tropical forest degradation must be resolved primarily through forest legislation and improved governance structures and not through eco-labelling.",,,,,2009-04-08,58,3,2009,,Articles,ART,,4,Christian,Lippert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,329_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Wie wirken gemeldete SPS-Maßnahmen? Ein Gravitationsmodell des EU-Rindfleischhandels,en_US,"For decades, nontariff trade barriers (NTBs) have been regarded as more problematic policy instruments than tariffs in international trade negotiations. This is due to the fact that trade impacts of nontariff trade barriers are less transparent than those of tariffs. Tariffication of nontariff agricultural trade barriers was finally decided under the Uruguay Round of GATT. Although the OECD concluded that a reduction of NTBs took place after 1994, this finding can be challenged. First, tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) are not counted as NTBs by law although they cause effects similar to those of quotas. The number of TRQs has increased strongly after the Uruguay Round. Second, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, i.e. SPS measures, have become more important as notifications under the SPS Agreement do show. There are only few empirical studies available which analyze the effects of these SPS measures.WTO Notifications under the SPS Agreement are utilized in this contribution for measuring trade impacts of sanitary and phytosanitary trade barriers. We explain the WTO data base on SPS notifications. Then, a gravitation model is applied to the EU beef trade in the period January 1995 to June 2001. It is investigated how SPS measures, introduced by non-EU countries in the context of BSE, affected bilateral trade with the EU. We distinguish between 31 product groups which might be affected, and a fixed-effects model is used for analyzing the panel data. We elaborate that SPS measures related to BSE reduced EU beef export revenues in the major product categories significantly. The NTBs did not reduce exports to zero, however, as might have been expected. The percentage reduction of export revenues was 49 % for live cattle, 74 % for fresh and cooled beef and 86 % for frozen beef. For most other product groups, the percentage decline in sales was significant but lower in percentage terms. Apparently, SPS notifications indicate that bilateral trade is restricted but it does not definitely show that the notified measures by the importing country are actually implemented and for which time period. It seems very important in future analyses of the SPS measures to distinguish carefully between SPS notifications and SPS measures.",,,,,2009-05-26,58,4,2009,,Articles,ART,,2,Marc,Kramb,Roland,Herrmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,146_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Die Risikoausgleichsrücklage als Instrument des landwirtschaftlichen Risikomanagements,en_US,"Due to an increasing variability in farm income because of extreme weather conditions and higher market volatilities, the German Farmers Association demanded the introduction of income equalization deposits for agricultural income to avoid a progression-based extra tax load and to support farmers building reserve funds. This article examines the economic effects as well as the legitimacy according to German tax law and its administrative practicability. Fundamentally, smoothing income over several years is admissible according to the German ability-to-pay principle. Nevertheless, a restriction to a particular group of tax payers is only acceptable if special circumstances faced by this group seem to make it necessary. This constraint demands restrictions on deposit and withdrawal which are linked to specific agricultural difficulties. Due to a couple of problems and difficulties in definition, measurement and valuation on an on-farm level, the administrative feasibility of these restrictions is limited. Different types of profit assessment for farmers complicate a fair and straight-forward usage. It is uncertain if income equalization deposits will be a useful risk management tool for farmers while simultaneously meeting all legal requirements in German tax law.",,,,,2009-05-26,58,4,2009,,Articles,ART,,3,Niklas,Blanck,Enno,Bahrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,144_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Consequences of a progressive reduction of direct payments in Germany: paving the way for post-2013?,en_US,"Due to Germany’s specific farm structure, the progressive modulation of direct payments decided within the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is of particular relevance for German agriculture. In this paper we apply the agent-based model AgriPoliS to shed some light on the structural effects of a progressive modulation as evoked in the Health Check (HC) proposal and the final agreement made in November 2008 for two German regions. Furthermore, we analyse whether a progressive modulation will allow for a continuous policy in the case of a reduced hypothetical single area payment of 150 €/ha starting in 2013. Results show that although we could observe substantial income effects in the short and long run, structural effects of the progressive modulation scheme are small but preservative. In contrast, the introduction of a reduced single area payment in 2013 would sharply increase structural change. In case the initial HC proposal is followed by a single area payment the previously observed policy effects would diminish for very large (above € 300,000 premium) and small farms (below € 100,000 premium). Still, although these effects are much less pronounced with the final HC agreement, the progressive modulation would provide farmers with wrong signals, as it is most likely that future reforms will be characterized by less support and thus require a stronger market orientation of farms.",,,,,2009-05-26,58,4,2009,,Articles,ART,,4,Konrad,Kellermann,Amanda,Sahrbacher,Christoph,Sahrbacher,Alfons,Balmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,145_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Entwicklung der Milcherzeugung in ausgewählten Regionen Baden-Württembergs - Prognose und kritische Entscheidungsfaktoren,en_US,"The abolition of the EU Milk Quota Regulation in 2015 will require milk producers to adapt. Their having to adapt is likely lead to structural changes both at regional level and at farm level. 411 milk producers in Baden-Wuerttemberg were surveyed in the course of the study (1 050 questionnaires, feedback 39 %). The main objective was to examine their likely reactions to the abolition of the milk quota regulation. The forecast shows that even in a favoured region for milk production, the overall output of milk could be reduced. Two groups of milk producers are compared by discriminant analysis. The farmers of the first group plan to quit milk production whereas the farmers of the second group intend to increase the output of milk.

,Preissenkung und Kompensation auf dem EU-Milchmarkt,en_US,"Soon after the 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, milk farmers started protesting against low milk prices. Though farmers gained public attention and sympathy for their case, the compensation payments included in the reform package are never part of the debate. Thus, only the income-decreasing side of the reform is pointed out. We empirically investigate to what extent the income reduction for dairy farmers is covered by the increased farm area payments in the 2003 reform. A comparison of milk prices prior to and after the 2003 reform indicates significant overcompensation. This comparison ignores the impact of world market price changes. Considering these by a vector error correction model leads to opposite results. Thus, up to now farmers are by far not compensated for the income loss generated by the price reduction in the 2003 reform.",,,,,2009-07-03,58,5-6,2009,,Articles,ART,,4,Jens-Peter,Loy,Carsten,Steinhagen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,139_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Milk quota expiry impacts and sensitivity analyses using the CAPSIM model,en_US,"Various scenarios for an expiry of European Union milk quotas are analysed with the Common Agricultural Policy SIMulation (CAPSIM) model. This comparative-static, partial equilibrium modelling tool covering the whole of agriculture for all EU member states has been disaggregated to represent nine secondary dairy products. Impacts are compared to a reference run where the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy Reform is projected into the future. The main milk quota expiry scenario is for 2020. Key results are that milk production would increase by 3.0% in EU-27 whereas milk prices would drop by 7.2%. The resulting decline in butter prices is shown to be larger if EU authorities cannot rely on export subsidies for market management. The regional pattern of impacts is strongly determined by the specification of quota rents. Furthermore, details of intra EU price transmission are shown to influence the differences between Member States. An applied welfare analysis of the main expiry scenario gives a significant redistribution from EU-27 farmers and much less from taxpayers to dairies and final consumers. The estimated small positive overall welfare gain would increase in a situation without export subsidies.",,,,,2009-07-03,58,5-6,2009,,Articles,ART,,5,Heinz Peter,Witzke,Axel,Tonini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,142_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The impact of quota rent and supply elasticity estimates for EU dairy policy evaluation: a comparative analysis,en_US,"The aim of this paper is to gain better insights in the implications of some of the most important economic assumptions and empirical choices made in partial equilibrium models focusing on dairy. Three partial equilibrium models are considered: the AGricultural Member states MODeling (AGMEMOD) model, the Common Agricultural Policy SIMulation (CAPSIM) model, and the European Dairy Industry Model (EDIM). This paper analyses how quota rent and supply elasticity estimates, as they are used in these models affect milk output and price projections. Sensitivity analysis is also considered in order to take into account uncertainty in quota rent and supply elasticity estimates. Taking into account the considered uncertainty our best estimate is in case of abolishing the quota the EU’s aggregate milk production will expand, with the increase being somewhere in the range between 5 and 15%.",,,,,2009-07-03,58,5-6,2009,,Articles,ART,,6,Roel,Jongeneel,Axel,Tonini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,138_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,20 years of transition in the agri-food sector,en_US,"Prior to 1989 the world could be divided “economically” into three clusters: (1) The Eastern Bloc with its socialist, planned economies, (2) the Western Bloc with its more market-oriented systems, and (3) the developing and emerging countries. Then, at approximately the same time, some major political events took place which contributed to the collapse of the Eastern Block, for example the 1985 elections of the Soviet Parliament, which have been linked to the terms ‘Perestroika’, ‘Glasnost’, and ‘Demokratisaziya’; the East German refugee camp in the German Embassy in Prague in September 1989; and last but not least the fall of the Berlin Wall. Thus came the beginning of the transition process from planned towards market economies in the former states of the Soviet Union (FSU) and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The challenges of transition were formidable. Private and public market-oriented institutions were absent and historical trading paths were interrupted. Many state-owned enterprises collapsed, the private sector was underdeveloped and the market organisations, as well as the producers and processors involved in the agri-food markets, did not know the rules of the “market” game. These issues led to deep and lasting economic distortions. Twenty years into the transformation of the agri-food sector in the approximately 30 countries that made up the former Eastern Bloc, it is time to recall the inherent changes that have occurred. Our introduction , but particularly the other contributions in this special issue on “20 years of transition in the agri-food sector – analyses of markets and policies” of the Agrarwirtschaft (vol. 58 with numbers 7 and 8), all serve as a platform to review the situation in the agri-food sector in light of the relatively heterogeneous country settings with regard to initial markets, policy and other institutions, as well as the subsequent driving forces of the transition process. 1. The ‘communist’ past and initial conditions. From a ‘western’ economic perspective, the agri-food sector of the former Eastern Bloc seemed organised in a coherent way. In reality, the Eastern Bloc countries had heterogeneous pre-reform characteristics. Countries differed in terms of the “length of time that the communist system [had] existed and the extent to which it was applied, in the distortions of the trade system and the forced integration with other communist countries, and in the level of economic development” (SWINNEN, 2007a: 19). Another differentiating feature “was the capital stock, the technology used in the farms, and the extent of the industrialisation of the agri-food chain” (ibid.). Thus, the initial conditions, including these systematic distortions, were quite heterogeneous. MACOURS and SWINNEN (2000) argue, however, that CEE countries, for instance Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia, were ranked at a lower level of initial distortions, while FSU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Ukraine encountered more severe distortions. Also with regard to the farming structure, tremendous differences existed. For instance, in the FSU or in Czechoslovakia, large farm structures (co-operatives or state-owned farms) dominated. Other countries such as Poland or Slovenia have been traditionally dominated by individual and rather small-scale farming. The differences in initial factor endowment and productivity, as well as the structure of the agri-food sector, in combination with political medium-term objectives, affected the choice of reforms. Today, the region presents itself in a very heterogeneous way with regard to structure and performance of the agri-food sectors. Overall, five important reform areas in the agri-food sector can be identified (CSÁKI, 2008). These are: (1) macro-economic and institutional reforms, particularly price liberalisation and subsidy cuts, (2) land privatisation and the reform of related organisations, (3) privatisation and modernisation of the agro-processing and food retail chain (value chain), (4) implementation of operational organisations related to the agri-food sector, and the (5) rural financial market. In the following, these reform areas are revisited and discussed. 2. Macroeconomic and institutional reforms The economic, legal and judicial, as well as political adjustment processes, as well as ongoing globalisation, have greatly impacted the agri-food sectors of the FSU and CEE. Already at the beginning of transition, fundamental reforms took place. First and foremost, the culture of setting production targets was dropped. Usually, the macro-economic reforms coincided with price liberalisation and cuts in both producer and consumer subsidies (HARTELL and SWINNEN, 1998). Additionally, reduced foreign demand after the collapse of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) trading system, falling consumer incomes and a breakdown of the supply chains and state-owned enterprises, all caused major disruptions and thus a squeeze in investment and output (SWINNEN, 2007a). Furthermore, the breakdown of the industrial and, to some degree the agricultural state enterprises in rural regions, resulted in previously unknown high rural unemployment rates (on average 21%) that in many countries lasted until the late 1990s and longer (KOESTER, 1997; WORLD BANK, 2000). Currently, the agricultural sector and its marketing chain in the former Eastern Bloc are of much higher importance than in Western European countries. One-third of the approximately 500 million people in the former Eastern Bloc live in rural areas and many of them still depend on the agri-food sector for a living. Nevertheless, in line with overall positive economic development and general reform progress, the share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP), as well as those employed in agriculture is decreasing. Because the reforms were quite different regarding speed and depth, today huge differences exist among these countries. In this context, one can speak of four groups: (1) market economy in the “old” new member states, (2) advanced reformers, (3) moderate reformers, and (4) slow reformers (HEATH, 2003; CSÁKI et al., 2006; CSÁKI, 2008). In general, one can say that the effective implementation of legislation supporting private entrepreneurial activities, as well as privatisation and decentralisation, have caused a sharp increase of private business activities in all CEE countries. In addition, the prospect of EU accession has created an environment more conducive to reform efforts, foreign investments, and the inflow of technology and know-how. Particularly in those countries at the cusp of EU accession, this prospect drove reforms. This trend could be observed in all economic sectors, not just the agri-food sector (e.g. CSÁKI et al., 2000; LERMAN, 1998 and 1999). Nevertheless, the privatisation experience in the FSU and CEE suggests that a state’s market-relevant institutions and organisations will tend to be unstable and corrupt so long as the competition for asset ownership remains unresolved among major interest groups. The theoretical and policy response, commonly referred to as the post-Washington Consensus , argued that the state needed to institute firm bases of market regulation and the rule of law prior to privatising entire economies. This institutional critique of markets paved the way for creating path-dependent reform programs tailored to specific countries. However, as the transition process did not allow for sufficient time to achieve this, transition seemed messier than normal politics and economics. Indeed, the sequencing and timing of reforms was often an issue of debate (transition in the FSU is often associated with a big bang while CEE opted more often for a gradual reform strategy). Eventually, institutions and organisations consistent with conventional economic fundamentals evolved once privatisation battles over assets were resolved (SCHWARTZ, 2006). 3. The impact of EU-policies on the transition progress. The possibility of EU membership accelerated reforms in the EU’s acceding and candidate countries, since EU membership required these countries to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, which includes the adoption of the acquis communautaire and its 2683 legal rules and regulations (COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 2006a; CSÁKI, 2008). Already two years after the accession of the ten new member states (NMS) , they had adopted 99% of the acquis – not always to the full satisfaction of the EU, but the possibility for changes and improvement was foreseen. The largest problems normally occurred in the legislation on competition (COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 2006a). Recognising the specific needs of the NMS with regard to restructuring demands and the characteristic farm dualistic structure, the EU implemented financial support programs to support sustainable rural development. Prior to EU accession, the SAPARD program in particular focused on the agri-food sector and rural infrastructure, and under this program both the administrative agricultural service chain and its beneficiaries (farmers, processors) gained first-hand experience with measures similar to those provided under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The majority of these funds were allocated to particular stages of the agri-food chain. For example, the support focused on investing in agricultural holdings and food processing (i.e., to facilitate the adoption of minimum [mandatory] quality standards), setting up producer groups (horizontal integration), or improving vocational training for actors in agri-business (knowledge transfer). However, it appears that mostly large units (farmers and processors) benefited from these measures due to their enhanced access to information and their possibilities to pre-finance and/or co-finance investment projects (COURT OF AUDITORS, 2004; LUCA, 2008). On the contrary, for most of the small and medium-sized units, a reduced capacity to co-finance investments (either through equity or debt-financing) was one of the main limiting factors that delayed the absorption of the SAPARD funds, especially in the first period of the program’s implementation (COURT OF AUDITORS, 2004). For CEE farmers, EU membership was both a challenge and an opportunity. On the one hand, farms (operators in agri-food business) in countries which have already joined, or intend to join, the EU have been confronted with considerable changes in the economic and regulatory framework, as well as in market conditions. On the other hand, access to the single market and the various instruments of the CAP under Pillars 1 (direct payments and market support measures) and 2 (measures under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) have opened new possibilities for farmers. The complementarities of the two CAP pillars were further strengthened with the CAP reform of 2003. Thus, one can state that the CAP reflects a policy shift that is called the New Rural Paradigm by the OECD (2006), and which places emphasis on regions rather than sectors, and investments rather than subsidies in rural development policy. In addition to the agri-rural development measures of the EU under Pillar 2, each member country is formulating a National Rural Development Program (NRDP). The NRDPs must be consistent with Community strategic guidelines, but they may indicate the nationally diversified priorities of action. For the NMS, additional transitional measures have been introduced in Pillar 2. These refer to the support of semi-subsistence agricultural holdings undergoing restructuring and the set-up of producer groups. Romania and Bulgaria, the newest member states, can potentially benefit from these measures until 2013. The objective of these measures is to improve the competitiveness of the agricultural sector by bringing small and semi-subsistence farms into the market (NRDP ROMANIA, 2008). In order to design a meaningful NRDP and to implement the policy measures effectively, the principle of decentralisation of responsibilities needs to be functioning, thus strengthening subsidiarity and partnership. For many NMS in CEE this is still a challenging task (MARQUARDT et al., 2009). Clearly, the introduction and strengthening of Pillar 2 was a well-received reform of the CAP. However, as for the NMS in CEE, the volume of the decoupled direct payments (notably the Single Payment Scheme which can be applied to area or farm units) under Pillar 1 are not only giving farmers a certain level of financial security but are also more substantial than the financial volume of measures under Pillar 2. Furthermore, the NMS can apply the simplified Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS) until 2013 or in the case of Bulgaria and Romania even until 2016. Nevertheless, the rather complicated bureaucratic procedures required to obtain the payments under the SAPS are preventing this measure from reaching many smaller farm holders, who are in principle eligible. Here it appears that smaller-scale farms are rather disadvantaged due to their limited management capacity. Another interesting feature of the CAP is the so-called compulsory modulation (see footnote 7), that is, reducing spending on Pillar 1 measures and transferring the funds to be spent on Pillar 2 measures of the CAP. A certain percentage share of the direct payments to bigger farms (those receiving more than 5,000€ of direct payments) is shifted to Pillar 2. Yet, this does not seem to make a significant difference for larger farms. What larger farms lose in Pillar 1, they may gain under Axis 1 “Improving the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sector” of Pillar 2 (CSÁKI, 2009; HAPPE et al., 2008; SAHRBACHER et al., 2008). Given the rather severe incidence of rural poverty and the lagging structural change in the farm sector of many CEE countries, including some of the NMS and the FSU, the question may be raised whether the CAP is sufficient to stimulate sustainable economic growth in the agri-food sector, respectively in the rural economy at large. A consensus is emerging that agri-rural policies alone cannot do the job. Farm exit options must be opened up, either in the sense of rural non-farm employment or via socially secure retirement (FELLMANN and MÖLLERS, 2009). Adequate social safety networks have to be installed; bearing in mind that the state budgets of many transition countries are already stressed to their limits. This challenge calls for a more concerted effort in which the national and international political stakeholders of the agri-food sector, of the economy at large and of the social sector work closely together. 4. Land privatisation and reform of related organisations. The transformation of the agri-food sector was always prominent because one of the major reforms entailed the privatisation of land. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) (and Albania) has adopted the ‘land to tiller’ strategy. This strategy implied that the land was allocated to workers of cooperatives without any payment in an equitable manner. In Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, individuals received paper shares that certified their entitlement to a certain amount of land. Most CEE countries (except Albania) have chosen to restitute the land to former owners. All CEE countries, plus the small CIS countries (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan) allocated physical plots to individuals (CSÁKI et al., 2000; NORTON, 2004). Often, an upper limit for land restitution was installed. The share system was intended to bring equitable land rights to the population, but it often brought about large-scale integrated farm structures and cooperatives (legal persons). Radical changes with regard to land tenure have been carried out in very few countries of the FSU. This is the case for Armenia, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic, where independent private farming now dominates. In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, private ownership of land is still prohibited by the constitution (CSÁKI, 2008). Where land was privatised, it was not so much driven by economic concerns, although theoretical considerations of land and labour productivity may have been considered. This privatisation process was rather prompted by a general sense of justice and had unintended effects in terms of land use changes and farm structures (SIKOR, 2009). Politics was willing to pay the economic price: an often-lamented dominance of small farm structures, a varied mix of small and large farm holdings, usually termed dualistic farm structure, or even land abandonment. Land consolidation is ongoing and is a critical issue for productivity gains. The legal settlement of land ownership relations is also not yet complete, and the establishment of land registries and the emergence of a land market remain priority areas for further reform, especially in the FSU. 5.

,Former Central European Free Trade Agreement countries’ agri-food trade specialisation,en_US,"The paper evaluates agri-food trade competitiveness and specialisation patterns of the former Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA-7) countries compared with the European Union (EU-15) from 1995-2007. Agri-food trade specialisation stability and duration are investigated by main agri-food product groups according to the degree of product processing and dynamics in the demand growth exhibited by the EU-15 market. Except for Poland and Hungary, the former CEFTA-7 countries face a trade deficit in agri-food products with the EU-15 markets. The former CEFTA-7 agri-food exports to EU-15 markets are specialised towards higher-value, processed, consumer-ready food as a result of agri-food sector restructuring and integration to more competitive EU markets. The former CEFTA-7 agri-food export specialisation towards the EU-15 markets’ most demanded products is also revealed. The results confirm that EU integration increases size of trade, stability, and the duration of former CEFTA-7 agri-food trade products on EU-15 markets.",,,,,2009-11-18,58,8,2009,,Articles,ART,,3,Štefan,Bojnec,Imre,Fertő,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,124_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Vertical coordination with growers in the supermarket fresh fruit and vegetables supply chain in Croatia,en_US,"This paper provides further evidence on vertical coordination as a means of overcoming supply disruptions and improving product quality. In contrast to previous studies, our findings suggest that the leading model of vertical coordination between fruit and vegetables growers and supermarkets in Croatia is restricted to loose, one-year contracts which mainly specify the terms of payment without providing farm assistance. Wholesalers more often provide farm assistance to fruit and vegetables growers. We expect that the wholesalers will drop out of the fresh fruit and vegetables (FFV) supermarket supply chain since supermarkets aim to streamline the procurement system by in-creasing local procurement directly from the farmers. Thus, the amount of farm assistance provided will further decrease. Therefore, for the rather small Croatian growers to integrate in the FFV supermarket supply chain, it is even more important that they organize to meet the supermarkets’ minimum quantity requirements and obtain access to a distribution facility.",,,,,2009-11-18,58,8,2009,,Articles,ART,,4,Linde,Götz,Mario,Njavro,Jon H.,Hanf,Agata,Pieniadz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,123_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Thuenen Rings of Biogas Production – the Effect of Differences in Transport Costs of Energy Crops in the Choice of Renewable Resources by Biogas Plants,en_US,"This paper discusses how differences in transport costs of energy crops affect the choice of feedstock used in biogas production. This is done by optimizing feedstock demand subject to transportation distances of the different crops. For this a von Thuenen type model is applied to the feedstock demand of biogas plants. In addition to yields in terms of quantity and energy concerning the different crops and the costs of having them available, the profitability of the fermentation plant must be considered. It is shown that silage maize is the most profitable crop for medium distances, but gives way to winter wheat as distances increase. Our analysis suggests that even bigger plants than today can be sustained exclusively with silage maize.

The analysis reveals a positive and significant effect of both farm programs on the area under cultivation, in particular on grassland, resulting in a decrease of cattle livestock density. Furthermore, participation to AE programs significantly reduced the purchase of fertilisers. For both farm programs, no significant effect on farm sales is observed.

This study analyses the factors that influence the German imports of olive oil by employing a gravity model. The results of two random-effects models corrected for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity suggest that being a Mediterranean Partner Country of the European Union has the highest impact on trade flows to Germany, thus supporting further Euromediterranean trade integration. Moreover, olive oil exports to Germany are positively related to the existence of direct marketing channels and to tourism.

,Does Strategic Group Membership Affect Firm Performance? An Analysis of the German Brewing Industry,en_US,"The concept of strategic groups has been successfully applied for analyzing firm strategies, structures and performance in various industries. Based on a large-scale empirical study, this paper identifies strategic groups in the German brewing industry and analyzes the effects of group membership on economic performance. The brewing industry is an interesting research object. The severe economic crisis German breweries face in their home market and the deep structural changes reshaping the global beer industry are forcing German breweries to rethink their strategic position. The analysis reveals a limited number of strategic groups and significant performance differences between these groups. Both results are in line with the central hypotheses of the concept of strategic groups. The empirical results enable firm managers to benchmark their breweries against more successful strategic groups, to better adapt corporate and competitive strategies to firm environments, to identify more profitable strategic positions, and to take action to switch from one strategic group to another.",,,,,2010-06-01,59,2,2010,,Articles,ART,,1,Ludwig,Theuvsen,Matthias,Heyder,Christoph,Niederhut-Bollmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,346_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

We apply the concept of Gollop and Monahan to measure the farm’s specific diversification. To analyze the relationships between income diversification and other farm’s and household’s specific factors, an econometric model has been estimated based on a comprehensive survey data. The results show that the main economic incentive for a farm’s diversification is the expected income increase, whereas risk minimization is less important. The access to resources (labor, capital) is an important requirement for tapping alternative economic activities. The formal agricultural education of the farmer is a significant factor: The higher his education the stronger is the tendency towards diversification. These findings are relevant for the design of agricultural policy measures which aim at explicitly meeting the heterogeneous needs of rural households.",,,,,2010-06-01,59,2,2010,,Articles,ART,,2,Christoph,Rathmann,Swetlana,Renner,Agata,Pieniadz,Thomas,Glauben,Jens-Peter,Loy,,,,,,,,,,,,,348_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

The results are discussed in light of the social science debate on farm development. Over the study period of 14 years the household strategies of 35 farming families led to professionalization in farming, while the household strategies of 18 families led to disengagement from farming.

,Economies of Scope in the Agricultural Provision of Ecosystem Services: An Application to a High Cost Production Region,en_US,"Joint production of agriculture commodities and environmental goods and services is a key attribute of multifunctionality. However, complex natural and economic interactions make a sound analysis difficult. In this regard, the concept of economies of scope provides a simple policy oriented indicator of jointness. Thus, the existence of economies of scope can be regarded as a precondition for the implementation of agricultural policies with respect to environmental goods and services. We apply the concept of economies of scope to the provision of ecosystem services in the Swiss lowlands using a spatially explicit economic-ecological programming model. Thereby, the consideration of non-agricultural competitors in the provision of ecosystem services allows a simultaneous assessment of economies of scope. A cost-effectiveness analysis shows the least-cost supplier of ecosystem services and spatial patterns in the supply for these services. Results imply the existence of economies of scope and hence strong jointness between agricultural production and the provision of ecosystem services. However, the potential for public cost savings due to structural change in agriculture is considerable. Moreover, the development of the second generation in biomass conversion technologies may enhance a non-agricultural provision of these services. Therefore, a continuous improvement in agricultural production efficiency is a precondition for strong jointness and thus multifunctionality.",,,,,2010-06-01,59,2,2010,,Articles,ART,,4,Robert,Huber,Bernhard,Lehmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,349_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,"Publishing as an Agricultural Economist: Thoughts on Why, Where and How",en_US,"Publishing provides the basis for scientific communication and thereby supports further scientific advances. Successfully publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals has become increasingly important for building an academic career, also for agricultural economists. The aim of this article is to motivate and encourage young agricultural economists with limited or no publishing experience to write research articles and submit them to peer-reviewed journals. In order to achieve this, some arguments are given ‘why’ peer-reviewed publishing is a worthwhile exercise. Then a look at journal quality and choice in our discipline addresses the ‘where’. Finally a significant part is devoted to ‘how’ to write a paper suggesting a potentially useful sequence of steps and discussing elements and style of a typical empirical research article.",,,,,2010-08-26,59,3,2010,,Articles,ART,,1,Thomas,Heckelei,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,374_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Analysing the Effect of Decoupling on Agricultural Production: Evidence from Irish Dairy Farms using the  Olley and Pakes Approach,en_US,Recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has led to the decoupling of direct payments to farmers from production. This policy change is expected to make farmers’ production decisions more market oriented as their subsidy revenue maximization objectives become profit maximizing objectives. In this paper we explore the impact of decoupling on the productivity of Irish dairy farms using a modified version of Olley and Pakes methodology for productivity estimation. We isolate the effect of decoupling on productivity by controlling for other policy changes that have occurred alongside decoupling. We also explore the effect that uncertainties associated with increased price volatility may have had on farmers’ decisions in the post-decoupled period.,,,,,2010-08-26,59,3,2010,,Articles,ART,,2,Andrius,Kazukauskas,Carol,Newman,Fiona,Thorne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,375_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Groundwater Management Instruments in a Conjunctive Use System: Assessing the Impact on Farmers’ Income Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP),en_US,"The objective of this paper is to compare the “relative” and the “absolute” impact on farmers’ income of several economic instruments which may be implemented to mitigate farmers' groundwater withdrawals in a multi-resource system. We conducted fine-tuned field work with farmers in order to understand the key factors of substitution between underground and surface water at the farm level. A mixed integer linear programming framework has been used to model fruit and vegetable production systems and to infer the impact of instruments on farmers` income.
Assuming this impact will sharply influence the acceptability of the instruments by the agricultural sector, we demonstrate why farmers’ acceptance is of central concern for both the design and the implementation of an environmental policy.
We further assessed the potential financial transfers that could be undertaken to increase acceptability. Our results echo scholars’ doubts about the capacity of taxes to manage irrigation water use. We suggest that a policy relying on a “well-priced” substitutable resource would be greatly favoured by farmers and potentially by policy makers, since it will sharply decrease the transaction costs arising from the implementation of the instrument.",,,,,2010-08-26,59,3,2010,,Articles,ART,,3,Vincent,Lenouvel,Marielle,Montginoul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,376_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Estimating the Demand for Sensory Quality – Theoretical Considerations and an Empirical Application to Specialty Coffee,en_US,"An increasing product differentiation coupled with an increasing availability of electronic data has boosted the number of hedonic price analyses applied to food and agricultural products. Most of these studies estimate the first stage of a complete two-stage model as proposed by ROSEN. However, there are also a few studies that estimate the second stage, i.e. supply and demand functions for characteristics. The present paper reviews both the theoretical and applied literature on Rosen’s two-stage model in the context of food and agricultural economics. Based on these findings, a theoretical model for specialty coffee auction data is proposed and tested empirically. The empirical model comprises non-linear hedonic bid functions at stage one and an inverse demand function for one characteristic, the sensory quality score (SQS), at stage two. The first-stage results indicate a high variability of the marginal price of the SQS across different auctions, i.e. across time and space. The second-stage results suggest that the marginal prices of the SQS increased in the analysed period 2003-2009 and that country-of-origin and buyer effects are important. The highest marginal prices are paid for Rwandan and Honduran coffee. At first glance, this is surprising, since at the first stage Honduran coffees are almost always sold at discounted prices compared to coffees of other origins. However, it seems that the SQS is a much more important quality cue for a coffee origin with a low reputation than for a coffee origin with a well-established reputation in the marketplace.",,,,,2010-08-26,59,3,2010,,Articles,ART,,4,Ramona,Teuber,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,377_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Impacts of Stockholding Behaviour on Agricultural Market Volatility:  A Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium Approach,en_US,"Successive CAP reforms raise the question of whether it can have a price-stabilizing capability. In this context more and more attention is being paid to private risk-managing instruments such as storage. The effects of storage have already been widely studied in the economic literature. But hardly any of these studies take account of the links between producers’, households’ and stockholders’ intertemporal decisions and, in particular, they do not use a dynamic CGE model. Furthermore, a large number of previous studies focus on the effect of stockholding on price volatility due to exogenous shocks and assume rational expectations. It is more the endogenous aspect of risk, induced by expectation errors, that has often been used to justify public intervention in agricultural markets. In this paper we construct a model addressing these issues and we conduct some illustrative simulations. Some of our results are at variance with the conclusions of previous economic studies concerning the effects of speculative storage on market volatilities. We also reveal the vital role played by the form of economic agents’ expectations and by the links between the intertemporal decisions of market participants.",,,,,2010-08-26,59,3,2010,,Articles,ART,,5,Fabienne,Femenia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,378_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Coordination and Differentiation of Strategies: The Impact on Farm Growth of Strategic Interaction on the Rental Market for Land,en_US,"Among the family farms in Western Germany, regional differences in farm-development strategies can be observed. The land market has been identified in the literature as crucial for farm growth. In various studies, developments are driven by assumptions about the effects of scale and the initial heterogeneity of farms. In contrast, the present paper focuses on the potential role of opportunistic and future behaviour for the development of different farm strategies. In order to demonstrate the potentially crucial role of strategic behaviour, we introduce a thought experiment and focus on the theoretical case of identical farms. In the light of ideas from theories about oligopolistic markets, two central problems of decision-making are identified: the coordination problem of farm exits and the problem of strategic choices made by the remaining farms. This paper supplements explanations that argue on the basis of farms’ heterogeneity in that it offers an approach to the question of why farms might not overcome their short-term constraints in order to realise strategic advantages in competition.",,,,,2010-08-26,59,3,2010,,Articles,ART,,6,Anne,Margarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,380_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Reflections on the Exceptional Treatment of Agriculture in the WTO,en_US,"The GATT gave special treatment to agriculture by allowing quantitative import restrictions when domestic output was also controlled, and made an exception to the ban on export subsidies by allowing them for primary products, subject to somewhat weak and imprecise conditions. Both were concessions to the operation of domestic farm policies in developed countries, primarily the US and the UK and later Canada and the EU, and full advantage was taken of these legal exceptions. Subsidies in general had been treated leniently in the GATT with merely the obligation to notify if they impacted upon exports. Domestic subsidies for agricultural products had significant impacts on both imports and exports and were seen to be a significant part of the trade problem, but operated under minimal constraints. So the exceptional treatment of agriculture in the GATT had led to a dysfunctional trade regime. The Uruguay Round faced up to the inchoate conditions on world markets and the deterioration of trade relations that these exclusions allowed. The Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) specifically banned quantitative restrictions on imports, except those introduced to guarantee access and banned new export subsidies, capping and reducing existing expenditures on the programs and the volumes that could be subsidized. Domestic subsidies that were deemed to be most trade-distorting were capped and modestly reduced. The Doha Round would, if completed, eliminate export subsidies, severely limit the ability to provide trade-distorting support, and reduce the bound tariffs by a considerable extent. The URAA was negotiated at a time when the US and the EU were the main players in the agricultural policy space and it represented a way of disciplining trade to avoid conflicts and reduce protection. Domestic policies were reformed in a way that was consistent with the URAA constraints. If the Doha Round is successful, most of the special provisions for agriculture will no longer be needed. But at that stage the URAA may inadvertently hamper the process of developing trade rules that meet new challenges.",,,,,2010-11-30,59,Supplement,2010,,Articles supplement,ASup,,4,Tim,Josling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,408_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Sales and Price Synchronization in German Food Retailing,en_US,"German food retailing is characterized by a strong price competition. Thus, we would expect the law of one price to hold and price adjustments to occur simultaneously. However, significant price differences can be observed which are often caused by sales. As price promotions are not related to supply or demand changes, they might bias measures of price synchronization. As dairy products are a key category that is often used in sales, we study the impact of price promotions on measures of price synchronization using dairy product prices in the German food retail market. Our results show with a very few exceptions that price promotions significantly bias the measures of price synchronization within and between stores. Over all stores and products 25% of regular prices are synchronized but only 10% of promotional prices occur simultaneously. Discounters synchronize regular price changes to a greater extent and promotional prices to a lesser extent. The level of price synchronization between stores indicates a positive correlation with the number of competitors and with the level of menu costs. Price synchronization is lower for perishable compared to durable products. Also, some store and chain effects are observed. Within stores, regular price changes of substituting brands are highly synchronized whereas price promotions are staggered within the same category.",,,,,2010-12-01,59,4,2010,,Articles,ART,,1,Angela,Hoffmann,Jens-Peter,Loy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,384_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Consumer Attitudes towards Ethical Attributes of Organic Food,en_US,"This contribution determines the relevance of ethical attributes of organic food exceeding the EU regulation on organic farming for consumers’ purchase decisions. The information acquisition behaviour of consumers regarding additional ethical values of organic food was analysed by means of an Information-Display-Matrix (IDM)and an accompanying consumer survey in five European countries. Seven ethical attributes were tested of which ‘animal welfare’, ‘regional production’ and ‘fair prices for farmers’ were identified to be most important. Consumers showed an increased willingness to pay for organic food with these additional ethical attributes. Thus, producers of organic food should increasingly focus on additional ethical attributes such as ‘animal welfare’, ‘local production’ and ‘fair prices for farmers’ in production and communication with consumers. With respect to the methodology used, the IDM turned out to be helpful in reducing the problem of social desirability of answers.",,,,,2010-12-01,59,4,2010,,Articles,ART,,2,Katrin,Zander,Ulrich,Hamm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,409_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Reputation of the German Meat Sector: A Structural Equation Model,en_US,"The German meat industry is increasingly subject to subject to controversy in public debate. The companies within the sector continue to be rather passive regarding this issue. As a consequence, the differences in opinion between society and meat industry have widened in recent years. Indications of a lack of acceptance are, for instance, public campaigns against agricultural building projects, reduced trust in the industry and increasing popularity of vegetarians in the population. In order to investigate the extent of these difficulties, this study analyses the reputation of the meat sector, using the Partial Least Squares Method (PLS). The results indicate that interest in and knowledge about the sector are generally rather poor.",,,,,2010-12-01,59,4,2010,,Articles,ART,,3,Frederike,Albersmeier,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,385_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Quantifying the Influence of Product Design on Perceived Taste and Purchase Intent for Wine Using a Characteristics Model,en_US,"A substantial expansion of wine supply has induced a strong product proliferation on the market. It is not only the taste of wines that has become more diversified, but quality signals are increasingly utilized, too. Quality signals include information on the wine bottle, such as origin, grape variety or brands. Additionally, there is a strong trend towards using the product design, i.e. bottle type or style of the wine label, as an instrument of product differentiation. The objective of this article is to analyze whether the product design affects the perceived taste of wine and the willingness to buy a wine. Primary data, which have been collected from an experiment combined with a survey of wine consumers, reveal that product design strongly affects the willingness to buy a wine. This strong effect occurs when the wine is tasted prior to the purchase decision. Interestingly, the product design affects consumers’ taste evaluation of the wine that is crucial for the consequential effects on the willingness to buy. An alternative modeling approach with a direct impact of product design on willingness to buy strongly underestimates the role of product design. A cluster analysis additionally reveals that product design and other quality signals do matter in some wine consumer segments but less in others.",,,,,2011-03-01,60,1,2011,,Articles,ART,,1,Gergely Szolnoki,Szolnoki,Dieter,Hoffmann,Roland,Herrmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,410_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Production and Factor Input under Conditions of Transition: Econometric Analysis of the Production Technology of the Ukrainian Milk Processing Industry,en_US,"In this study estimation results of alternative production functions for the Ukrainian milk processing industry at the sectoral level are presented. Several special cases of a translog production function are estimated on the basis of a data set consisting of monthly time series for the period January 1996 to December 2003. The analysis focuses on key parameters of the production technology, such as the elasticity of scale, the elasticity of substitution of production factors and the rate of technical progress. The estimation results show that neoclassical production functions are less suited for the analysis than the unrestricted translog production function. Because of the special situation of the Ukrainian milk processing industry during the transition process, it can even be misleading to describe the production technology by a neoclassical production function. Thus, the marginal product of labour turns out to be negative, which is incompatible with neoclassical production theory. However, in view of the low capacity utilization this is not implausible. The estimation results with respect to the elasticity of scale cannot be interpreted unambiguously. The rate of technical progress is 2.7 % p.a. in the second half of the investigation period, while in the first half it is negative. The size of the Allen elasticities of substitution of production factors is calculated to be almost negligible.",,,,,2011-03-01,60,1,2011,,Articles,ART,,2,Oleksandr,Perekhozhuk,Michael,Grings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,411_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Determinants of Competitiveness of „Extended Family Farms“ – Empirical Results from a Survey of Farm Managers,en_US,"Due to an intensifying competition, gaining and sustaining competitive advantages have become increasingly important for family farms in recent years. In the course of general structural changes in agriculture, so-called “extended family farms” have emerged as a predominant form of farming businesses in many, mainly western parts of Germany. Through combining traditional family-labour-based governance structures with additional non-family labour, extended family farms can realize economies of scale. Thus, they are often considered a sustainable type of organisation that is able to cope with international competition. So far existing research has not fully explored the factors determining the competitiveness of extended family farms. Against this background, this article analyzes potential determinants of competitiveness of extended family farms on the basis of a survey of 103 farm managers. The empirical results show that the success of the farms surveyed is not only based on the realization of technical economies of scale, but also on the personality of the farm managers and the strategies implemented.",,,,,2011-03-01,60,1,2011,,Articles,ART,,3,Christian,Schaper,Mark,Deimel,Ludwig,Theuvsen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,412_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Does the Consumer Really Knows which Quality he Buys? A Study about the Expected Quality from Quality Labels,en_US,"Quality labels for food products are an important consumer policy tool and are used for product diversification strategies by the producers. In the literature, the effectiveness of such labels concerning the purchase behaviour of consumers has been doubted. In this context, our paper compares the guaranteed quality of three labels – QS, CMA and BIO – with their expected quality by the consumer. The QS label and particularly the BIO label are process-orientated and characterized by a high level of control and sanctions. The CMA label assured, till its termination in 2009, a specific sensory quality accompanied with less rigorous mechanisms of control and sanctions. The results of a representative online survey indicate that consumers expect the same quality level from the CMA label and the QS label, although, in fact, QS guarantees a higher process quality. The CMA label can differentiate from the others in consumers’ perception as a regional origin label, whereas the BIO label stands out for the material dimension of quality including safety and quality items. To conclude, the perception of the material quality of labels (e.g. CMA label) can be biased by positively valued ideational product attributes. Thus, it is supposable that the consumer assesses the quality better than it actually is.",,,,,2011-03-01,60,1,2011,,Articles,ART,,4,Sabine,Kubitzki,Stephanie,Krischik-Bautz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,425_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,"The Biofuel Sustainability Regulation: A First Step towards a Sustainable Bioenergy Policy, or rather, another Piece of Red Tape?",en_US,"At 1 January 2010, the German Biofuel Sustainability Regulation which implements the requirements set out by EU directive 2009/28/EC entered into force. For the first time, these regulations define legal sustainability standards for biomass used for energy production. The main criteria are a minimum level of greenhouse gas savings and the avoidance of negative environmental impacts. However, the analysis of these regulations casts doubt on the achievability of its targets: Rather than the desired improvement in the sustainability of biomass production, increased market segmentation is the likely outcome. A broader regulation is constrained both by its practicability (e.g. in the case of quantification of indirect effects) and by the legal framework of the WTO (use of trade distorting measures). Hence, the attempt to cover general environmental aspects and particular biofuel related sustainability aspects within one single regulatory framework seems an unpromising avenue towards improved sustainability of biomass production.",,,,,2011-05-26,60,2,2011,,Research news,RNews,,1,Stefan,Busse,Bernhard,Brümmer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,429_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Relevance of Certification Marks and Geographical Indications when buying Beef – Results of a Representative Consumer Study in Bavaria,en_US,"While for the time period 1995 to 1998 significant and positive welfare effects and a consumer willingness-to-pay could be measured for the origin and certification mark “Qualität aus Bayern” there is a new situation after the BSE crisis due to changes of several impact factors. In the framework of this paper we analyze if certification marks still have relevance when buying beef. For this purpose we conduct an empirical consumer study in Bavaria. At this we focus on the label “Geprüfte Qualität Bayern”, the denomination Bavarian Beef which is meanwhile registered as protected geographical indication (PGI) according to regulation (EC) 510/06 and the label “Qualität und Sicherheit” (QS). The results show significant but varying effects for all analyzed labellings.",,,,,2011-06-01,60,2,2011,,Articles,ART,,3,Adriano,Profeta,Richard,Balling,Sabine,Will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,427_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Impact of Biogas Production on Farmland Rental Rates in Germany,en_US,"Biogas production has received considerable attention in Germany. Especially during the last years many biogas plants have been built due to increased feed-in tariffs for electricity guaranteed by the German renewable energy law. We analyse whether the use of arable and pasture land to produce ‘feed’ for the biogas plants increases farmland rental rates. The analysis is based on farm-level data of newly contracted rental agreements in 2005 and 2006 collected by the national agricultural census. We apply a spatial econometric approach to estimate the determinants of rental rates which explicitly takes dependence among neighbouring rental rates into account. Agricultural biogas production, measured as the share of acreage cultivated with energy crops, increases the rental rates in Western Germany significantly, but not in Eastern Germany. The estimated annual sum of additional rental payments due to biogas production projected on the whole rented acreage in Western Germany amounts to approximately € 7 – 9 m. However, for rental agreements contracted after 2006 a higher impact on rental prices is expected.",,,,,2011-06-01,60,2,2011,,Articles,ART,,4,Hendrik,Habermann,Gunnar,Breustadt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,426_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Development of Productivity in Organic and Conventional Agriculture: An Empirical Analysis,en_US,"This article sets out to investigate the development of total factor productivity in organic and conventional agriculture in the period from 1999/2000 to 2006/07. Productivity development is assessed with the use of Malmquist Indices based on Stochastic Frontier Ana-lysis. The analysis is based on a balanced panel of farm records of 151 organic and conventional farms, respectively. A matching procedure is applied to identify for each organic farm a conventional counterpart with similar structural features. The study reveals a similar development of productivity in organic grazing livestock and mixed farms, but the productivity level is still lower compared to their conventional counterparts. Only organic arable farms had started off with a higher level of productivity in 1999/2000 but they were not able to maintain their advantage over their conventional counterparts. The Malmquist analysis highlights that these changes cannot be attributed to low rates of technical progress. Lack of technical and scale efficiency are rather to be seen as the key drivers of the slowed productivity development in organic agriculture.",,,,,2011-06-01,60,2,2011,,Articles,ART,,5,Torben,Tiedemann,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,428_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

In behavioural economics framing effects are acknowledged as important factors influencing perception of information. In this paper framing effects are analysed by means of an experiment using the example of information about folic acid. The results give evidence that framing influences consumers’ perception, the need for information and decision process even though the effect is small.

,Are Business Management Games a Suitable Tool for Analyzing Bounded Rational Behavior of Economic Agents?,en_US,"Regulatory policies often aim to steer the behaviour of economic agents by changing their framework conditions. Assessing the impact of such policies requires forecasts of how humans adapt to changes in their economic environment. A prerequisite for a meaningful policy impact analysis is a profound knowledge why and to what extent economic agents behave in a bounded rational way. We propose that business management games be used to contribute to a better understanding since they provide an inexpensive opportunity to reach beyond the existing anecdotic evidence of “behavioural anomalies”. Modifying an existing business management game, in which investment, financing and production decisions have to be made, we demonstrate how bounded rationality can be quantified and separated into its two components: incomplete information and limited cognitive abilities. The resulting data indicate that the decisions made by the participants of the game have been strongly influenced by bounded rationality. They also show that both incomplete information and limited cognitive abilities are relevant components of the bounded rationality that has been displayed by the players. Regulatory impact analysts who base their forecasts a priori on the standard rational choice assumption cause the risk of measures being designed for economic agents that do not exist in reality.",,,,,2011-09-01,60,3,2011,,Articles,ART,,2,Oliver,Mußhoff,Norbert,Hirschauer,Philipp,Hengel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,437_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,What Explains the Success of Product Innovations? An Analysis with Scanner Data for the German Market of Yoghurt,en_US,"A high degree of product proliferation is characteristic for many markets of processed foods, as is an increasing competition due to globalization and a further liberalization of agricultural markets. It seems increasingly important to secure market shares and sectoral income on unregulated food markets, e.g. by the successful introduction of new food products. It is the objective of this article to elaborate for a market with a high degree of product differentiation, i.e. the German yoghurt market, which determinants may affect the success of product innovations. To examine this question, scanner data are utilized. The success of innovations is measured by the revenue reached within a year after the introduction of a new product in a specified number of stores. As all selected products remained on the shelves for at least 12 months after their introduction, we compare product innovations with a minimum degree of market success among each other. Multiple regression analyses reveal that the variation of revenues across 41 new products can be explained by more than 90 % with ingredients and other attributes of the products, with the type of the marketing channel, with characteristics of the innovations and dummy variables for the names of the manufacturing firms. Interestingly, it is not so much the price premium of an innovation that matters as it is often stressed in hedonic analyses. According to our success criterion, it is more important to realize a sizeable share of the market in order to create a particularly successful new product.",,,,,2011-09-01,60,3,2011,,Articles,ART,,3,Roland,Herrmann,Rebecca,Schröck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,438_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Agricultural and Environmental Policies from an Institutional Economics Perspective: a Method for Ex-ante Policy Assessment,en_US,"Ex-ante impact assessment of agricultural, environmental, and rural policies has become an integral part of political decision-making processes in the European Union. While a variety of agri-environmental modelling tools exists which are able to predict social, economic, and ecological consequences of policies, there are no standardised ex-ante policy assessment tools capturing the institutional dimension. In this paper, we introduce a procedure for ex-ante modelling institutional aspects for policy implementation. PICA (Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment) is a systematic methodology to assess the institutional compatibility of policy options with the respective national and regional institutional contexts. PICA has been designed as an explorative, yet formalised methodology that enables policy-makers to identify, at an early stage, potential institutional incompatibilities. After a brief introduction of the concept of institutional compatibility for policy assessment, the four distinct steps of PICA are elaborated. Subsequently, the practical and empirical processes as well as the results of the application of PICA for the (in the year 2007) planned implementation of the EU-Nitrate Directive in the Département Puy-de-Dôme in the Auvergne, France, will be presented. In the conclusions we stress PICA’s explorative character and give an outlook on the further methodological development of the procedure.",,,,,2011-09-01,60,3,2011,,Articles,ART,,4,Christian,Schleyer,Insa,Theesfeld,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,439_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Non-parametric Risk-adjusted Efficiency Measurement: An Application to Pig Fattening in Germany,en_US,This paper presents two approaches to integrating risk into Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The risk-adjusted DEA models are applied to a balanced panel of 278 farms with alternative degrees of specialisation in pig fattening. Both models explicitly take account of output risk in determining efficient benchmarks. Output risk is measured and included in both models as standard deviation of total farm gross margin but different assumptions are formulated with respect to the correlation of the output among observations. Contrasting the results of the two risk-adjusted models to those of the standard DEA model reveals significant differences in efficiency scores. The empirical results support the hypothesis that farms with a low degree of specialisation in particular achieve higher efficiency scores when output risk is explicitly accounted for.,,,,,2011-12-01,60,4,2011,,Articles,ART,,1,Torben,Tiedemann,Gunnar,Breustedt,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,440_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Biogas Production in Germany – Should the Energetic Use of Manure be Explicitly Promoted?,en_US,"For the politically desired increase in the use of renewable energies, in particular an increase of biogas production based on agricultural residues such as manure is regarded as beneficial. Although this residue can be supplied without any production costs, the biogas production made in Germany increased especially based on cultivated energy crops. The predominant part of the accruing manure is not used yet. In this paper, therefore, the need for additional promotion of energetic use of manure is discussed. The results based on literature values and investment calculations show that the avoidance of greenhouse gases (GHG) with biogas from manure causes a high potential and low external cost compared to biogas of corn silage. Manure transports influence the costs of GHG mitigation strongly; nevertheless low transport distances may be accepted. However, individual economic barriers exist for the use of manure instead of energy crops. An increase of manure proportion often increases the electricity production costs especially if manure has to be transported. In conclusion, it seems to be appropriate to promote the energy use of manure with the aim of a high utilization of the existing potential and an avoidance of unwanted effects to the land markets.",,,,,2011-12-01,60,4,2011,,Articles,ART,,2,Jochen,Thiering,Enno,Bahrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,443_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Response of the German Agricultural Sector to the Envisaged Biofuel Targets in Germany and Abroad: A CGE Simulation,en_US,"This article analyses the impact of national, European and global biofuel targets on German food production and land allocation until 2020. The LEITAP General Equilibrium Model simulates the interaction of agricultural and energy markets in response to the envisaged expansion of the biofuel industry. First generation biofuels are integrated in the production structure of the petroleum sector. Second generation biofuels are modelled indirectly via estimated bottom-up reductions in land available for agriculture. Biofuel targets are set exogenously according to the current policy goals. The model recursively responds to increments in the biofuel mandates over three time intervals. Each country or region is required the meet its respective target and is allowed to subsidize biofuel consumption through a budget-neutral mechanism. Thanks to a nested land specification, changes in land use take into account variable elasticities of substitution among different cultivations. The results indicate that German production of biofuel crops substantially increases. In particular, oilseed output experiences a remarkable growth. Land allocation and land prices also change significantly. However, higher production does not suffice to satisfy the demand for biofuels feedstock, and imports of oilseeds and sugar rise considerably. Moreover, the model suggests that the growth in biofuel crop production among the remaining EU-26 countries is driven by the new Member States of the EU, and that the supply of EU biofuel crops also has to be enhanced by imports from abroad. Biofuel policies outside Europe show only little additional impact on German agriculture. The projected changes in food commodity prices are in line with the results of other CGE analyses, although prices rise to a lesser extent than projected in studies based on Partial Equilibrium Models.",,,,,2011-12-01,60,4,2011,,Articles,ART,,3,Giovanni,Sorda,Martin,Banse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,442_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Relationship between Technical Efficiency and Economic Success: The Case of Bavarian Dairy Farms,en_US,"The objective of this article is to reveal the relationship between technical efficiency and the economic success of dairy farms and to determine farm specific factors affecting both. The data set contains observations of more than 2 000 Bavarian dairy farms in an unbalanced panel covering the years 2000 to 2008. We use the stochastic frontier approach to analyze the technical efficiency of farms. Economic success is measured by the performance indicator “Nettorentabilität”, which is the rate of return on farm owned production factors. Findings show an average technical efficiency of 88,2 % and an average “Nettorentabilität” of approximately 57 %. A rank correlation test indicates a strong positive relationship between technical efficiency and economic success. We calculate the marginal effects of possible determinants of technical efficiency and economic success and reveal that both improve with farm mangers education level, full-time farming and soil quality.",,,,,2011-12-01,60,4,2011,,Articles,ART,,4,Magnus,Kellermann,Klaus,Salhofer,Wolfgang,Wintzer,Christian,Stockinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,441_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Economic Valuation of Irrigation under Consideration of Risk and Changes in Water Withdrawal Permits,en_US,"The European Union has established the Water Framework Directive (WFD) as a legal framework to protect all aquatic ecological systems including groundwater. This directive is primarily aiming at water protection and may have advantages for the water regime in sensitive areas. Nevertheless, it may also involve economic disadvantages for agricultural enterprises. In this paper we analyze the economic implications of the WFD for farmers using irrigation, i.e., the negative economic consequences for farms resulting from a reduction of water withdrawal permits in the north-east of Lower Saxony. In a whole farm risk programming approach we show how much benefit farmers loose if the amount of water withdrawal permits is reduced. To avoid solutions that would possibly exceed the farmers’ risk tolerance, the apparently accepted standard deviation of the program’s total gross margin is used as an upper bound in the optimization. This should represent an observable reflection of the individual risk attitude of the farmers. The results demonstrate that deterministic approaches do not consider all economic impacts caused by the reduction of water withdrawal permits as well as that risk has to be considered.",,,,,2012-03-01,61,1,2012,,Articles,ART,,1,Ulla,Kellner,Oliver,Mußhoff,Henning W.,Battermann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,448_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The State-Contingent Approach in the Context of Mathematical Optimisation,en_US,"The strong dependence on exogenously determined states of nature (weather, diseases, pests, etc.) is a constituent element of most agricultural production processes. While this state contingency creates uncertainties, it likewise offers various possibilities to react to particular states of nature (e.g. through irrigation or pest management). A concept which in principle accounts for these contexts is the so called state contingent approach originally developed by CHAMBERS and QUIGGIN. This approach comprises the state contingent depiction of the production process under uncertainty as basis for a realistic representation of individual decision making as well as the resulting market reactions. The following article deals with the state contingent approach in the context of mathematical programming. It starts with the description of the conceptual foundations of the approach and subsequently focuses on its implementation in the context of mathematical programming under uncertainty. The comparison with conventional mathematical programming approaches using an example documents the conceptual advantage of the state contingent approach, but also clarifies the methodical challenges which result from its complexity.",,,,,2012-03-01,61,1,2012,,Articles,ART,,2,Ernst,Berg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,451_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Biases in Farm-Level Yield Risk Analysis due to Data Aggregation,en_US,"We investigate biases in farm-level yield risk analysis caused by data aggregation from the farm-level to regional and national levels using the example of Swiss wheat and barley yields. The estimated yield variability decreases significantly with increasing level of aggregation, with crop yield variability at the farm-level being up to 2.38 times higher than indicated from national data. Our results show furthermore that inference on shape parameters based on aggregated data might be misleading. Using an example of farm yield insurance, we show that using crop yield variability estimates from aggregated levels leads to erroneous insurance contract specifications.",,,,,2012-03-01,61,1,2012,,Articles,ART,,3,Robert,Finger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,452_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

The analysis was conducted using detailed information on the implementation of the Health Check policy package for agricultural activities in each of the 27 member states, which is included in the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact (CAPRI) model. In the simulation experiments, the transition from individual to uniform per-hectare rates at the country level was explicitly modelled. The results show significant income shifts only for single products, such as durum wheat. Moreover, income was redistributed away from traditional “Grandes Cultures” crop production to fodder production, an effect primarily caused by the capitalisation of decoupled premiums on previously unsubsidised land. Cattle, sheep and goat production was primarily affected in the animal sector.

,Risk Management on Farms: An Analysis of the Acceptance of Weather Insurance using Discrete Choice Experiments,en_US,"The question of how the increasing challenges of on-farm risk management – that e.g. result from the global climate change – could be met, has been an important subject of research for a long time. For instance, it has been discussed if index-based insurance are an alternative to classical hedging opportunities of weather risks. While science have mainly focused on the conception, pricing and hedging effectiveness of new weather risk management instruments, a research gap exists regarding the farmers’ subjective perception of weather risks, the analysis of implemented on-farm measures for weather risk reduction as well as regarding the measurement of farmers’ preferences for different risk management instruments. On the basis of survey data, this study investigates which meteorological events farmers perceive as very risky, which measures they already apply to reduce the risk and which costs are involved. Using a discrete choice experiment, beside the demand for weather insurance also the influence of performance defining features of different insurance on their selection probability is determined. Results show that farmers often are not able to quantify the costs of the risk management instruments applied so far. Even given high basis risks, they would, therefore, demand for yield insurance as well as index-based insurance if those are sold at a favorable price. Moreover, results  show that the demand for insurance rises with increasing risk involvement of the agricultural enterprises as well as – against all expectations – with decreasing risk aversion of the decision makers.",,,,,2012-06-01,61,2,2012,,Articles,ART,,1,Ulf,Liebe,Syster Christin,Maart,Oliver,Mußhoff,Philipp,Stubbe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,464_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Impact of Climate Change on the Economics of Dairy Farming – a Review and Evaluation,en_US,"The impact of climate change has become a major concern within the agricultural profession. While many studies on Climate Change Impact Assessment (CCIA) deal with crop farming, little has been done with regard to livestock farming. This paper aims to shed light on the present state of research in the field of dairy farming, one of the major sectors in agriculture, in a three-fold manner. First, potential climate change impacts in dairy farming are discussed qualitatively. Second, challenges and methodological approaches in economic CCIA are presented, with a closer look at the issue of climate data and farm-level adaptation. Third, an overview and assessment of available studies on economic CCIA in dairy farming along a set of evaluation criteria is provided.

,The Pattern of Austrian Dairy Farm Household Strategies,en_US,"Developments in the agriculture sector, such as the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy reforms and the increasing volatility of the markets due to liberalisation processes, pose far-reaching challenges to farm household development, and especially the most affected sectors, such as dairy farming. It is assumed that individual farmers develop strategic approaches to their future farming activities (farm household strategies) in order to react to these developments. This involves reconsidering existing approaches and developing new strategies, both on and off the farm. In order to evaluate these developments, it is necessary to first evaluate the current pattern of farm household strategies. This paper identifies and examines the farm household strategies of Austrian dairy farmers in order to better understand farm household development. Secondary data analyses on the basis of a survey of Austrian dairy farms conducted by the Federal Institute of Agricultural Economics Vienna provided the required information for the em-pirical identification of various types of farm household strategy. The analyses revealed a pattern of six types of farm household strategy within Austrian dairy farms: (1) genuine specialisation, (2) concentration, (3) horizontal diversification, (4) lateral diversification, (5) stable reproduction, and (6) disengagement. The study underlines the significance of socio-economic as well as demographic and farm characteristics which were used to identify and describe types of farm household strategy.",,,,,2012-06-01,61,2,2012,,Articles,ART,,3,Monika,Krammer,Manuela,Larcher,Stefan,Vogel,Erwin,Lautsch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,467_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Animal Welfare: An Empirical Analysis of Agricultural Frames,en_US,"According to the current state of livestock sciences the assessment of animal welfare nowadays is based on four dimensions, i. e. good housing, good feeding, good health and appropriate behaviour (KEELING and KJÆRNES, 2009). However, it remains unclear to what extent this understanding of animal welfare is shared by farmers. The aim of the present study is thus to estimate the concerns of conventional German pig farmers about animal welfare by means of a factor analysis. For this purpose the theoretical concept of framing is applied. The results show that two animal welfare frames exist among respondents. While an animal welfare understanding that focuses on biological and technical aspects is highly approved, criteria based on (natural) animal behaviour play only a minor role.",,,,,2012-06-01,61,2,2012,,Articles,ART,,4,Ingke,Deimel,Annabell,Franz,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,468_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Measuring the Subjective Risk Attitude of Decision-Makers: Are there Differences between Groups of Methods and of Persons?,en_US,"Many studies quantifying individual risk preferences of test persons show that results of different measuring methods may vary. Additional reservations about the reliability of the results arise from the fact that most studies are based on convenience groups, such as students or business-men in developing countries. With this in mind, we systematically compare different measuring methods to answer the question how the choice of method affects the results. Moreover, we compare the risk preferences of German farmers to those of students and Kazakhstani farmers in order to investigate whether farmers’ risk preferences can be approximated through those of convenience groups. The methods applied comprise an incentive-compatible Holt and Laury lottery, as well as two psychometric methods, namely self-assessment and the selection of a business-related contextualized statement, with which the test persons are most likely to agree. Results show that the risk preferences determined by applying the aforementioned methods exhibit slightly positive but significant correlations across all three elicitation methods. Significant differences, however, only exist between the responses of students and those of German farmers, implying that it is not possible to draw conclusions from the risk attitudes of students to those of farmers. The comparison of the risk preferences of German and Kazakhstani farmers, however, reveals significant similarities with respect to the self-assessment and the business-related contextualized statements.",,,,,2012-09-01,61,3,2012,,Articles,ART,,1,Jörn,Ewald,Syster Christin,Maart,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,473_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Farmers’ Preferences regarding the Design of Substrate Supply Contracts for Biogas Plants: A Choice Experiment,en_US,"Substrate supply, which is often regulated by corresponding contracts, is essential for a sustainable expansion of renewable energies generated in biogas plants. To the authors’ knowledge, no quantitative investigations of farmers’ preferences with regard to supply contracts for biogas plants have been carried out so far. Hence, it has been only possible to a limited extent to make predictions for a targeted ar-rangement of supply contracts. We, therefore, investigated, to what extent different factors have relevance for the conclusion of substrate supply contracts. This has been done by conducting a survey with 178 German farm managers. The survey included a choice experiment in which participants were confronted with different contract features. These features were varied systematically and thus revealed the influence of each individual feature on the probability of contract conclusion. It becomes clear that the farmers who were interviewed preferred to conclude contracts with other farmers or with a bioenergy village rather than with external investors. The probability of contract conclusion decreases with an increasing lifetime of the contract. However, a contract with a higher sales price is more attractive for the farmers. The investigation of the characteristics of respondents shows that the amount of the premium for one additional year of contractual lifetime depends on the individual valuation of the entrepreneurial freedom of the respective farm manager. It cannot be established that risk-averse farmers tend to prefer contracts with fixed prices over contracts with price adjustment clauses. In addition, there are no great differences in the choice behavior of farmers who have already signed a substrate supply contract and farmers without this experience.",,,,,2012-09-01,61,3,2012,,Articles,ART,,2,Christian,Reise,Ulf,Liebe,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,474_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Data Quality of Performance Measurement Systems based on Internal and External Accounting in the Inter-Company Evaluation of Pig Production and Hog Fattening,en_US,"Subject of the paper presented here is the analysis of benchmarking systems, which are used in consulting for the comparison of pig farms and for the identification of success factors. There are mainly traditional full costing and marginal costing systems used. Opinions about the necessity and the quality of full-cost accounting are controversial. In the paper will be identified how cost accounting systems reflect the operational reality for inter-company comparison and can be used as a valid basis for recommendations for management decisions. Further, the source of the data is questioned. For economic reasons, it is recommended by some organizations to use accounting information or data of the financial statements for analysis. In the paper will be clarified how data from the external accounting system can be used for benchmarking, or whether the separate collection of data, such as the ZDS Erzeugerringdatenbank, is necessary and reasonable.",,,,,2012-09-01,61,3,2012,,Articles,ART,,3,Ulf,Morfeld,Michael,Stahlschmidt,Joachim,Krieter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,475_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Property Rights Problems in Agricultural Cooperatives: A Heterodox Institutionalist Perspective,en_US,"New institutional economists have identified a number of property rights problems in agricultural cooperatives. This paper reconsiders these problems from the perspective of heterodox institutionalist economics in the tradition of Veblen and Ayres. The property rights problems of agricultural cooperatives seemingly reinforce the new institutional economics presumption of the superiority of fully delineated private ownership. In contrast, the paper shows these problems to be likewise consistent with the heterodox institutionalist school, which is much more reserved about the societal role of private ownership. Toward this end, the paper elaborates the logical structure of the so-called “institutionalist dichotomy”. The property rights problems of agricultural cooperatives are explained as a particular manifestation of this dichotomy.",,,,,2012-09-01,61,3,2012,,Articles,ART,,4,Vladislav,Valentinov,Constantine,Iliopoulos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,472_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Home Bias in Consumption: A Comparison between Wine and Beer,en_US,"This paper investigates the determinants of home bias in consumption in the beer and wine markets across 15 ‘old’ member states of the European Union (EU) during the period 2000-2009. Two main results are obtained using a theory-driven gravity equation. Firstly, the home bias in beer consumption is several orders of magnitude higher than that of wine. Secondly, and interestingly, consumer preferences seem to be driving the home bias in the wine sector. In contrast, the home bias in beer is widely attributable to the home market effect, namely firms tend to localize near the consumers in order to minimize the high trade costs associated with beer exports.",,,,,2012-12-01,61,4,2012,,Articles,ART,,1,Alessandro,Olper,Daniele,Curzi,Dario Gianfranco,Frisio,Valentina,Raimondi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,483_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Effects of the M&A Wave in the Global Brewing Industry 2000-2010,en_US,"The brewing industry has experienced massive changes over the last decade. Industry concentration has increased dramatically, and the leading brewing groups have globalised their operations across virtually all continents. Based on a major data base the paper traces some causes and assesses the main effects of the M&A strategies in the global beer industry. The results verify that the 4 large acquiring brewing groups are more efficient than a control group of 200 large breweries but they have not performed significantly better in the period.

,Revisiting the Impact of Trade Liberalization and Mergers on the Malting Industry of North America,en_US,"This paper builds on the work of BUSCHENA and GRAY (1999) to look at the effects of mergers in the North American malting industry as ten firms in two separated markets merged into four firms in an integrated market. We explore the sensitivity of our results to the assumption of market power. We show that welfare gains from free trade are not generally lost but can face considerable redistribution under reasonable assumptions of market power. Varying the rival reactions did not change the result that total economic surplus with four firms after NAFTA is greater than when there were ten firms but no trade. Mergers reduce the trade gains of malt consumers and barley producers in both countries and reduce the welfare losses of malting plants in the U.S. According to our estimates, the second wave of mergers may have led to a positive total welfare effect for malting plants in Canada if the oligopoly is exercising significant market power.",,,,,2012-12-01,61,4,2012,,Articles,ART,,3,Derek,Brewin,Richard,Gray,Giannis,Karagiannis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,485_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

How the Change in Consumption Shares of Alcoholic Beverage Types Affects Traffic Mortality in Young People,en_US,"This paper uses cross-state and cross-regional time series to estimate the effect of the variation in shares of alcohol beverage types on traffic fatalities in young people, with particular emphasis on consumption of beer versus spirits, or “hard liquor”. Depending on the specification, consumption shares matter for traffic fatalities in the 15-19 year age group, but results are not conclusive.

,The Relation of Village and Rural Pubs with Community Life and People’s Well-Being in Great Britain,en_US,"In Great Britain the make-up of rural communities is changing. Young individuals are moving to cities and the population of rural communities is ageing. In this context, it is important to sustain and enhance people’s well-being and community cohesion. The purpose of this paper is to show that pubs are important facilitators of community cohesion and ultimately well-being of residents. This is done by compiling a database of secondary data at the parish level of rural communities of England. From this data, measures of community cohesion and social interaction are derived and correlated with the number of pubs within the parish. Pubs are found to be statistically significantly positively associated with community cohesion and social interaction. The paper goes on to construct regression and path models to relate the number of pubs and community cohesion and interaction to self-reported health as a proxy for well-being. Significant positive associations are again found. These findings provide a strong case to foster the sustainability of rural pubs.",,,,,2012-12-01,61,4,2012,,Articles,ART,,5,Ignazio,Cabras,Jesus,Canduela,Robert,Raeside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,487_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Wie der Osten gewonnen wurde: Restrukturierung der Versorgungskette im osteuropäischen Biermarkt,en_US,"Like all markets in the former communist countries, the Eastern European beer market has been strongly affected by the economic reforms in the beginning of the 1990s. In the first years after reforms, there was a substantial decline in the production of barley, malt and beer. However, the brewery sector soon attracted interest from foreign investors, who faced problems in sourcing sufficient high quality malt in order to produce high quality beer. Therefore, they reintroduced vertical coordination in the supply chain to obtain malt and barley that consistently met their quality requirements. The associated change in beer quality has been one of the drivers behind the spectacular growth of beer consumption in several Eastern European countries. Most remarkable was the growth in the Russian beer market, where beer consumption more than quadrupled over the course of a decade. In this paper, we describe and analyze the dramatic restructuring of the beer industry and the changes in the industrial organization of its supply chain over the past two decades. In addition, we document how the drastic improvement in the quality of beer has been an important driver behind rapid growth in beer consumption in Russia.",,,,,2012-12-01,61,4,2012,,Articles,ART,,7,Kristine,Van Herck,Johan F.M.,Swinnen,Koen,Deconinck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,481_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Contract Management of Dairies after Phasing out of the Milk Quota,en_US,"As a result of the expiry of the EU milk quota on April 1st 2015, raw milk procurement in the German dairy industry faces major changes. Delivery contracts between dairy farmers and milk processors are the basic coordination mechanism of business relationships and need thus to be adapted to the altered market situation. We analyze empirically the farmers’ preferences for different stipulations (pricing systems, volume control and the duration of the contract) and test if their attitudes towards contracting in general have an influence on contract choice. Results illustrate that farmer-suppliers’ preference for cooperatives, trust in prices and a focus on entrepreneurial goals increases the likelihood to choose the classical cooperative contract. Based on the results, we discuss implications for contract management in dairies.",,,,,2013-03-01,62,1,2013,,Articles,ART,,1,Stephanie,Schlecht,Nina,Steffen,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,491_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Quality and Endogeneity Issues in Demand Systems: A comparative Estimation of Price and Expenditure Elasticities of the Demand for Organic and Conventional Vegetables in Germany,en_US,"This paper provides insights into the demand of German consumers for organic and conventional vegetables. The merging of two household panels allows, for the first time, the joint analysis of the markets for fresh and frozen vegetables. The underlying panel is a unique dataset covering grocery purchases of more than 13 000 households over a period of five years. The objective of the analysis is to derive demand elasticity estimates as well as to compare the results obtained from various estimation methods. Based on a two-step LA/AIDS, additional models which take account of potential price and expenditure endogeneity as well as of seasonal, regional and quality differences, are estimated. Especially product groups with a relatively small budget share exhibit significant differences in elasticity estimates. Therefore, it seems particularly important to consider the above mentioned issues when analyzing the demand for organic food. Results suggest an inelastic demand for conventional and a somewhat elastic demand for organic vegetables. If expenditures increase, consumers raise their demand for organic vegetables at a higher rate than their demand for conventional vegetables. Cross-price elasticities appear to be asymmetric. Demand for organic vegetables is more sensitive to price changes of conventional vegetables than vice versa.",,,,,2013-03-01,62,1,2013,,Articles,ART,,2,Rebecca,Schröck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,492_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,A Cohort Analysis of Food-at-Home and Food-away-from-Home Expenditures in Germany,en_US,"Over the last decades and across countries, eating patterns have changed in favour of increasing consumption of food away from home. According to Ando and Modigliani (1957), consumers pass through different stages of a life-cycle with different impacts on demand. The criticism that life-cycle theory neglects generational effects and concentrates only on ageing effects has led to the application of the cohort analysis, which decomposes not only age, but also period and cohort effects. This paper presents the results of a cohort analysis on food-at-home and food-away-from-home consumption covering 25 years of German consumption data. The results of seemingly unrelated regressions indicate that there are significant age, period and cohort effects on food-at-home and food-away-from-home expenditures, which are more distinct for food-at-home consumption. This paper also finds evidence for the significant effects of gender, occupation, household composition and region on both expenditure categories. For instance, the effect of being female is negative on both types of expendi-tures. Moreover, there is a non-linear relationship between household size and both food-at-home and food-away-from-home-consumption.",,,,,2013-03-01,62,1,2013,,Articles,ART,,3,Larissa S.,Drescher,Jutta,Roosen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,493_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"The Determinants of Farm Growth, Decline and Exit in Estonia",en_US,"The process of structural changes in Estonian agriculture is influenced by both socioeconomic factors that are similar in other western countries and transition-related factors. This current paper aims to investigate the effects of such socioeconomic factors on the probabilities of farm growth, decline and exit relative to retaining the previous farm size. The survey and agricultural registers’ data are used for multinomial logit estimation. The results indicate that the farm growth probability is highest in the 40-49 year age group. The availability of successors significantly reduced farm exit probability, and the level of education of the farm operator increased the farm growth probability. While off-farm work was more probable in smaller farms and in cases of more educated and younger farm managers, it was evident that the off-farm employment of the farm operator significantly increased the probability of farm exit. While the larger farms have a higher probability of remaining in business, and lower probability to exit or decline, they do not have higher growth probability. Participation in a semi-subsistence farming scheme reduces the exit probability. It has been shown that farms founded during the beginning of transition due to restitution have lower decline and growth probabilities, indicating that such farmers are emotionally more inclined to maintain the farms of their forefathers.",,,,,2013-03-01,62,1,2013,,Articles,ART,,4,Ants-Hannes,Viira,Anne,Pöder,Rando,Värnik,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,496_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,What Do We Know about the Influence of Agricultural Support on Agricultural Land Prices?,en_US,"This study gives an overview of the theoretical foundations, the empirical procedures and the derived results of the literature on the determinants of agricultural land prices. A particular interest is given to the effects of government support policies. Almost all empirical studies on the determination of land prices either refer to the net present value method or the hedonic pricing approach. While the two approaches have different theoretical basis, they converge in their empirical implementation. Empirical studies use a broad range of variables to explain land values and we systematise these into six categories. In order to investigate the influence of different measures of government support on land prices, a meta-regression analysis is carried out based on 242 observations from 26 articles. Results indicate that a 10% decrease of agricultural support would decrease land prices by 3.3% to 5%. Therefore, a considerable part of farm subsidies is realized by initial owners of land instead of operating farmers. Results in regard to differences in capitalization for different support measures are ambiguous. Model assumptions, data structure and estimation techniques do have a significant influence on capitalization estimates.",,,,,2013-06-01,62,2,2013,,Articles,ART,,1,Paul,Feichtinger,Klaus,Salhofer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,508_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Non-Agricultural and Supra-Regional Investors on the German Agricultural Land Market: An Empirical Analysis of their Significance and Impacts,en_US,"Investments in agricultural land have recently gained particular public attention both in the international and national context. In Germany, the recent increase in sale and rental prices for agricultural land has often been linked to the activities of non-agricultural investors. The aim of this study is to take stock of these activities and to explore the relevance of non-agricultural and supra-regional investors. Further, it is aimed at investigating the impact of such activities on the land market, agricultural structures and regional development. Four regional case studies are carried out, three of them in the New Länder (former GDR). In each case study region, structured interviews were conducted with about ten farm managers and ten regional experts. Results show that the group of ‘non-agricultural investors’ is very heterogeneous and cannot be delimited by clear indicators. Thus, the core question about the relevance of their activities can only be answered with respect to the type of inves-tor. Judgements as regards their impact are highly dependent on the selection of regional case studies, the type of interviewees and their respective interests.",,,,,2013-06-01,62,2,2013,,Articles,ART,,2,Andreas,Tietz,Bernhard,Forstner,Peter,Weingarten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,509_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Price Formation on Land Market Auctions in East Germany – An Empirical Analysis,en_US,"Although determinants of agricultural land prices have received considerable attention in the literature, little is known about price formation on structured markets such as land auctions. This paper aims to empirically test theoretical predictions regarding price formation in land market auctions. The analysis is conducted for the case of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, where state-owned land constitutes a significant share of the agricultural land market. The utilised data consists of public auction data provided by the Land-gesellschaft Sachsen-Anhalt (i.e. the rural development agency in Saxony-Anhalt), and covers approximately 700 calls for bids from 2003 to 2010, supplemented with regional and structural data. Spatial correlation of land prices is considered by applying a spatial econometrics approach.

,The Effect of Heterogeneous Buyers on Agricultural Land Prices: The Case of the Czech Land Market,en_US,"This paper analyses how different types of buyers affect the farmland price. We specify a flexible hedonic land pricing model that allows for non-uniform valuation of land characteristics among buyers. Data on 579 land sale contracts from five districts of the Czech Republic from 2008-2010 are utilised in the study. The results provide strong evidence of buyer-specific valuation of land’s productive and site characteristics as well as systemic differences in land market conditions among groups of buyers, both of which affect the land price. Non-agricultural buyers are observed to significantly overbid agricultural buyers on land location and site characteristics rather than productive qualities. Among agricultural buyers, joint stock companies and cooperatives enjoy major land price discounts, while individual private farms and limited liability companies face land market access constraints that are surmountable only through paying high price premiums. These observations have important implications for future land ownership structure and land use efficiency.",,,,,2013-06-01,62,2,2013,,Articles,ART,,4,Jarmila,Curtiss,Ladislav,Jelínek,Martin,Hruška,Tomáš,Medonos,Václav,Vilhelm,,,,,,,,,,,,,511_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Impact of Economic Transformation and the Credibility of Planning Control on Agricultural Land Values,en_US,"This paper develops a hedonic model of agricultural land prices to investigate the efficacy of planning controls, whose raison d’être is to regulate the conversion of farmland. While development (commercial, industrial and residential) potential of farmland <affects agricultural land values in all countries, its impact is potentially more acute in Newly Industrialised Countries where development pressure is strong and planning law is often weakly enforced. In the Malaysian land market, which epitomises this situation, State Authorities have approved a large number of applications to convert land from agriculture to development, such that the market is inclined to behave as if planning control lacks credibility. To investigate the influence of 'development potential' on land legally designated as agricultural in Malaysia, an extensive dataset of over 2,000 land sales has been assembled. Using this database we attempt to estimate the effect – the development rent – on land price, which turns out to be high, exceeding 400% of agricultural value in some cases. From there, we draw some conclusions regarding the efficacy of existing planning controls and the implications of such a high premium.",,,,,2013-06-01,62,2,2013,,Articles,ART,,5,Haniza,Khalid,Timothy Adrian,Lloyd,Christopher Wyn,Morgan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,512_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Animal Welfare in Public and Private Standards and On-Farm Compliance,en_US,"This paper evaluates the animal welfare situation on cattle farms in Germany and Austria applying a multidimensional assessment framework. Using minimum requirements formulated in public legislation and private certification schemes, animal needs indices are calculated. They are subsequently compared with results from on-farm surveys. Most private certification schemes address animal welfare in their requirements but this does not necessarily result in higher levels of farm animal welfare if they only overlap with existing national standards. The on-farm evaluations showed that most farms already voluntarily over-comply with some of the standards imposed by public legislation or private labels. Thus, proposals to simply increase standards to improve farm animal welfare without considering the already implemented on-farm animal welfare level have to be evaluated with caution.",,,,,2013-09-01,62,3,2013,,Articles,ART,,1,Dominic Norbert,Annen,Christine,Wieck,Markus,Kempen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,527_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Price Promotions and Psychological Pricing in German Grocery Retailing,en_US,"Price promotions play a prominent role in German grocery retailing. Their purpose is to increase store traffic and strengthen customer loyalty. It is hypothesized that other marketing tools, like psychological pricing can add to the positive impact of price promotions on sales. Thus, we investigate the joint impact of price promotions and different pricing points on sales. Our empirical analysis shows that just-below prices tend neither to raise sales of regularly priced products nor of price promoted products. The only exception is significant price reductions combined with 99 ending prices (especially of private labels). While our results show no alternatives to regular 9 ending prices, price promotions should rather end in a 99 or be round. Moreover, repdigits (eye-catching price figures) can significantly increase sales of price promoted manufacturers’ labels when other cues of price promotions exist.

,Segmentation of Customers of Horticultural Non-food Products in Southern Germany,en_US,"The paper aims to identify clusters of buyers of horticultural products (non-food sector) in Germany based on behavioral factors as well as to determine the relevance of the different discriminatory variables. Data were obtained from 320 face-to-face interviews conducted in Southern Germany. Cluster and discriminant analysis were used to analyze the data. Eight clusters of buyers of horticultural products are identified which show significant differences concerning their socio-demographic characteristics, purchase behavior and buying motives. Gender and the affirmation of the respondent to purchasing or non-purchasing bed, balcony or potted indoor plants are the most important discriminatory variables. The differing behavior and interests of the eight consumer clusters allows fine-tuning of marketing activities of horticultural products within the analyzed distribution channels. Traditional retail shops should aim to attract younger consumers in future. The paper extends previous consumer research by identifying consumer cluster for horticultural products based on behavioral factors.",,,,,2013-09-01,62,3,2013,,Articles,ART,,3,Andreas,Gabriel,Klaus,Menrad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,522_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Call for papers,en_US,"European agricultural development, climate change and food security interact in complex ways. Climate change, for example, will induce regional shifts of crop production, while mitigation measures in the livestock sector will increase production costs, especially in case major reduction schemes are agreed upon like the EU goal of 80% emission reduction by 2050. Such mitigation measures may have strong effects on food supplies and food security, both inside Europe, and also on a global scale. European agriculture also seeks for opportunities implementing climate smart agriculture, to balance mitigation/adaptation strategies, while maintaining productivity in agriculture. European strategies for smart, green, and inclusive growth also aim at increasing the role of the biobased economy, processing agro-raw material for biofuels, pharmaceutics, textile and new bio-medical material. What are potential win-win actions for mitigation that could reduce costs and emissions? How to address water scarcity as part of adaptation strategies in agriculture to cope with climate change? What are the relevant economic drives of agricultural development at different scales (farm, sectoral, regional, European, and global)? How does climate change impact international trade, both within Europe and with other non-European countries? Against this background the special issue aims at understanding the recent developments related to European agriculture and climate change, particularly in Germany and the EU. The focus will be on quantitative modelling and empirical analyses.

,The Risk Reduction Potential of Weather Derivatives in Crop Production: Simple Indices versus Mixed Indices,en_US,"Weather derivatives are impaired with a basis risk that reduces the risk reduction potential and possibly hinders the introduction of these risk management instruments in the agricultural sector. A frequently suggested approach to reduce the basis risk is the use of mixed indices composed of several weather variables. The present study compares the risk-reduction potential of a temperature index-based and a precipitation index-based weather derivative to a derivative based on a mixed index including the two weather variables temperature and precipitation. This comparison is based on empirical winter wheat yield data of arable farms in Central Germany as well as on daily weather data of individual weather stations over several years. The hedging effectiveness is maximized using the hedging model by Johnson (1960). The results empirically prove that the improvement of the risk reduction potential of weather derivatives based on a mixed index improves significantly in comparison to single-index derivatives. However, it is more advantageous to use several weather derivatives based on a simple index at the same time than using one derivative based on a mixed index if the weather variables of the mixed index were measured at just one weather station. Hence, providers of weather derivatives would do better by offering different weather derivatives based on a simple index than derivatives that are based on a mixed index. In particular this is worth considering with regard to the fact that weather derivatives based on simple indices will surely attract the interest of other sectors more easily. Furthermore, by showing that farm-individual optimally designed weather indices have a significantly higher risk reduction potential than standardized weather indices, this study provides an important progress for the question about the design of weather derivatives. Hence, providers of weather derivative should better offer different weather derivatives with single index-based, farm-individual, optimally designed indices than a derivative based on a mixed index. The focus of the present study may be relevant for farmers as well as for potential providers of weather derivatives.",,,,,2013-12-01,62,4,2013,,Articles,ART,,1,Niels,Pelka,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,528_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Factors affecting Participation and Compensation Requirements  in Agri-Environmental Schemes: Insights from a Discrete Choice Experiment,en_US,"This paper uses data from a discrete choice experiment to investigate the factors affecting participation in agri-environmental schemes in Eiderstedt and Südtondern, two grassland regions in Schleswig-Holstein. As expected, higher payment rates increase farmers’ willingness to sign a conservation contract whereas stricter management prescriptions reduce participation. Besides contract design variables, a number of farm-specific variables affect farmers’ willingness to participate. Farmers, for instance, with previous experience in agri-environmental contracting are more likely to choose a contract than those without such experience. Our estimates of marginal willingness-to-accept show that farmers regard contractual obligations relating to fertilizer use and mowing dates as particularly demanding, resulting in high compensation requirements of €100 - 200 per hectare. Farms with high land use intensities – e.g. high stocking rates or low shares of permanent pasture – request higher compensation payments than less intensive farms.",,,,,2013-12-01,62,4,2013,,Articles,ART,,2,Gunnar,Breustedt,Norbert,Schulz,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,529_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Calibrating Agri-Environmental Schemes using a Two-Stage Discrete Choice Experiments,en_US,"Discrete choice experiments (DCE) have been in-creasingly applied to assess farmers’ preferences for alternative designs of hypothetical agri-environmental schemes. We extend the DCE approach by asking farmers not only to choose among alternative conservation contracts but also to choose the land area they would put under contract. This extended approach allows us to formulate optimal contracts (in terms of management prescriptions and payment levels) taking explicitly account of the effect of contract design and farm characteristics on the participation area. We use a multinomial Heckman model. In its first stage, we estimate the probabilities of specific contract types being chosen and the corresponding marginal willingness to accept (WTA) figure. In the second stage, we identify the factors affecting the land area offered under contract by means of an OLS regression which takes account of the sample selection bias from first-stage choices. Based upon the estimates from both stages, contracts for a hypothetical conservation scheme are optimized such that environmental benefit is maximized given alternative program budgets. The results show that the optimal design of conservation contracts is sensitive to the program budget.",,,,,2013-12-01,62,4,2013,,Articles,ART,,3,Gunnar,Breustedt,Norbert,Schulz,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,530_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,An Investigation into the Factors which Determine Farmers’Acceptance of Supply Contracts: The Ethanol Beet Example,en_US,"Little is known about the actual behavior of farmers who are offered forward contracts for renewable resources. The present survey explores farmers’ acceptance of sugar beet supply contracts. We find that the farmers’ responses are not in line with forecasts that are based on critical prices derived from naïve gross margin comparisons. Instead, farmers take into account that the contractual obligation to supply a certain amount of beets in combination with the volumetric production risk produces an asymmetry in revenues. They also consider risk and dynamic changes of the relative competitiveness of sugar beet and competing crop alternatives. We furthermore find that the past matters: a subsequent improvement of a contract offer that is made after an initial offer has been rejected by farmers finds lower acceptance than an initially better offer.",,,,,2014-03-01,63,1,2014,,Articles,ART,,1,Oliver,Mußhoff,Norbert,Hirschauer,Markus,Fahlbusch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,549_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Heterogeneous Farm Output and Technical Efficiency Estimates,en_US,"Farmers in most OECD countries are engaged in different activities which go beyond agriculture. When assessing farm performance, it is appropriate to model these heterogeneous farm outputs separately. In this study, we use the distance function approach, which allows the consideration of technology with multiple outputs and multiple inputs. We compare estimates from single-output technology with estimates from multiple- output technology. Our empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced panel of dairy farms in the plain region of Switzerland for the period from 2003 to 2009. We choose the parametric estimation method and employ a translog specification of the production technology. The test of output separability favours a model that separately considers three different outputs: agricultural output; para-agricultural output; and direct payments. The separate modelling of direct payments has considerable influence on the estimated technology parameters as well as the technical efficiency scores. The consideration of direct payments as a separate output increases the elasticity of land by a factor greater than two and, accordingly, reduces the distance function elasticities of other inputs. The average technical efficiency estimates do not differ substantially when specifications differ. However, we reveal serious differences in the estimates of technical efficiency for individual farms. The estimated rank correlation coefficients show that the ranking of farms in terms of technical efficiency differs considerably when direct payments are modelled as a separate output.",,,,,2014-03-01,63,1,2014,,Articles,ART,,2,Phatima,Mamardashvili,Raushan,Bokusheva,Dierk,Schmid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,550_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,"Discrepancies between the Intentions and Behaviour of Farm Operators in the Contexts of Farm Growth, Decline, Continuation and Exit – Evidence from Estonia",en_US,"A considerable body of research on farmers’ behaviour is based on the surveys regarding their behavioural intentions. The theory of planned behaviour states that while the formation of intentions normally precedes behaviour, several factors affect the realisation of the intended behaviour. Therefore, the usefulness of ex-ante surveys for predicting farmers’ behaviour requires more attention to reduce the potential biases in such analyses. The paper investigates how well the farmers’ intentions correspond with the behaviour in cases of farm exits, continuation of farming and farm size changes in Estonia. Based on the farm survey in 2007, the follow-up survey in 2011, and paying agency’s registry data, the ex-ante data on the intentions is combined with ex-post data on actual behaviour. A recursive bivariate probit regression is used to study the effects of selected socioeconomic characteristics on the probabilities of intended and realised behaviour, and the effects of stated intentions on actual behaviour. The results indicate that the usefulness of intentions in predicting actual behaviour differs, depending on the nature of the question in the farm life cycle context. Intentions are found to be a better predictor of actual behaviour when the considered event is regarded as positive (continuation of farming and farm growth) rather than negative (farm exit or farm shrinkage).",,,,,2014-03-01,63,1,2014,,Articles,ART,,4,Ants-Hannes,Viira,Anne,Pöder,Rando,Värnik,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,553_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Profitability of Seasonal Mountain Dairy farming in Norway,en_US,"In this paper the economics of seasonal production of cheese in the mountain in Norway is investigated and compared with keeping the cows at the farm, investing in a common pasture or in co-operative dairy farming. The comparison is based on calculations in a linear programming (LP) farm model supported with Stochastic Dominance with Respect to a Function (SDRF) for risk analysis. Mountain dairy farming involves free ranging cows on natural pastures for about 70 days. The contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, CLA and various antioxidants in the milk increase when cows graze alpine pastures affecting its processing properties, and flavor and chemical content of dairy products. Seasonal mountain cheese production is found to be generally preferable to the other alternatives for risk neutral as well as risk-averse decision makers. This is due to a higher price for mountain products, subsidy payments for mountain farming, and exemption for farm processed milk in the national milk quota. The risks are partly price risks but also yield and output risks as well as downside political risks since the profitability depend strongly on subsidies and premiums, and exemption for farmprocessed milk in the milk quota. Investments in farming co-operatives were unprofitable due to less subsidy payments compared to individual farmers. Effects of calving time, introducing fertilized pastures or night pens, and supplementary feeding to extend the mountain period and sustain milk yields are examined. The premium price for “mountain products”, animal welfare, and farmer co-operation on marketing are discussed.",,,,,2014-06-01,63,2,2014,,Articles,ART,,1,Leif Jarle,Asheim,Tor,Lunnan,Hanne,Sickel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,555_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Convenient Prices in the Quick Service Sector,en_US,"Due to changes in demographic and social circumstances, the importance of food-away-from-home consumption increases. However, detailed facts on pricing strategies in this sector are still missing in Germany. This paper aims to provide cross-sectional evidence of pricing strategies in the quick servicesector. The focus lies on convenient prices, which according to KNOTEK (2011) simplifies the purchase due to a lower number of necessary monetary units. Convenient prices that match round prices ending on monetary denominations prevail. The only exceptions are fast-food-restaurants, which offered often odd prices. Consequently, in these stores at least one monetary unit more than in takeaway shops would be necessary to pay for the products. The study shows that there are common principles in pricing strategies in the quick service sector and the retailing sector, but also differences.",,,,,2014-06-01,63,2,2014,,Articles,ART,,2,Anke,Möser,Laura,Kriep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,556_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Using a Generalized Differenced Demand Model to Estimate Price and Expenditure Elasticities for Milk and Meat in Austria,en_US,"Applying a generalized demand system approach, we estimate both current price and expenditure elasticities in the Austrian food retail market based on a dataset covering a time period of approximately ten years. Within the framework of a three-stage-budgeting approach, more disaggregated demand reactions for milk products and types of meat are estimated. Conformable with demand theory, price reactions are found to be less elastic the more aggregated the product groups are. Generally, demand for pork and beef turns out fairly price-elastic. Similarly, price reactions for cheese and milk are stronger than average estimates for European markets. Substitution patterns are more distinct than those found in a comparable study for Germany. In addition, our study indicates the importance of modeling a comprehensive budgeting process rather than isolated levels of product aggregation when deriving both price and expenditure elasticities of demand.",,,,,2014-06-01,63,2,2014,,Articles,ART,,3,Andreas,Widenhorn,Klaus,Salhofer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,557_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Do we Need to Consider Bounded Rationality and Heuristic Decision Making when Trying to Understand the Weak Development of Weather-Index Insurance Markets in Agriculture? – An Exploratory Invest,en_US,"Weather-index insurances are innovative risk management instruments that - compared to conventional insurances - cause low administration and regulation costs and are not accompanied by moral hazard or adverse selection problems. Despite these advantages, farmers make little use of weather-index insurances as yet. With this in mind, the present study focuses on the question if bounded rationality provides an explanation for the missing willingness to adopt this type of insurance. For lack of a natural experiment, an “extralaboratory experiment” is carried out in the form of a multi-period, single-person business simulation game with students of agricultural sciences. Two major questions are to be answered: first, does the demand for weather-index insurances change if the subjects are not only informed about the total insurance premium but also about the loading? Second, does demand change in a framing where subjects are told that the (unchanged loading) is the result of a subsidized insurance offer? In the experiment, the explicit communication of the loading did not have a significant effect. However, demand increased in the subsidization framing. This indicates that government funding is per se considered as a quality signal and that subsidized actions are preferred without an individual analysis of their relative competitiveness.Wetterindexversicherungen stellen innovative Risikomanagementinstrumente dar, die gegenüber herkömmlichen Versicherungen den Vorteil geringer Administrations- und Regulierungskosten aufweisen. Darüber hinaus entstehen keine Moral-Hazard- und Adverse-Selection-Probleme. Dennoch werden Wetterindexversicherungen in der Landwirtschaft bisher kaum eingesetzt. Vor diesem Hintergrund geht es im vorliegenden Beitrag um die Frage, ob begrenzte Rationalität ein Erklärungsansatz für die fehlende Adoptionsbereitschaft sein kann. Mangels eines natürlichen Experiments wird hierzu ein „Extra-Laboratory- Experiment“ in Form eines mehrperiodischen Einpersonen- Unternehmensplanspiels mit Studierenden der Agrarwissenschaften durchgeführt. Durch das Experiment sollen zwei zentrale Fragen beantwortet werden: Erstens, verändert sich die Nachfrage nach Wetterindexversicherungen, wenn den Teilnehmern explizit kommuniziert wird, welchen Anteil der Aufpreis an der gesamten Versicherungsprämie hat? Zweitens, verändert sich die Nachfrage in einem Framing, in dem sich der für die Teilnehmer unveränderte Aufpreis durch eine Subventionierung ergibt? Im Experiment hatte die explizite Kommunikation des Aufpreises keinen signifikanten Einfluss auf die Nachfrage. Mit einer Subventionierung von Wetterindexversicherungen stieg (bei gleichbleibenden Kosten) allerdings die Nachfrage. Dies ist ein Indiz, dass eine staatliche Förderung als Gütesignal wahrgenommen wird und subventionierte Handlungen auch ohne Analyse ihrer relativen ökonomischen Vorzüglichkeit bevorzugt werden.",,,,,2014-06-01,63,2,2014,,Articles,ART,,4,Oliver,Mußhoff,Sven,Grüner,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,554_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Linking an Economic and a Life-cycle Analysis Biophysical Model to Support Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Policy,en_US,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation is one of the main challenges facing agriculture, exacerbated by the increasing demand for food, in particular for livestock products. Production expansion needs to be accompanied by reductions in the GHG emission intensity of agricultural products, if significant increases in emissions are to be avoided. Suggested farm management changes often have systemic effects on farm, therefore their investigation requires a whole farm approach. At the same time, changes in GHG emissions arising offfarm in food supply chains (pre- or post-farm) can also occur as a consequence of these management changes. A modelling framework that quantifies the whole-farm, life-cycle effects of GHG mitigation measures on emissions and farm finances has been developed. It is demonstrated via a case study of sexed semen on Scottish dairy farms. The results show that using sexed semen on dairy farms might be a costeffective way to reduce emissions from cattle production by increasing the amount of lower emission intensity ‘dairy beef’ produced. It is concluded that a modelling framework combining a GHG life cycle analysis model and an economic model is a useful tool to help designing targeted agri-environmental policies at regional and national levels. It has the flexibility to model a wide variety of farm types, locations and management changes, and the LCA-approach adopted helps to ensure that GHG emission leakage does not occur in the supply chain.",,,,,2014-09-01,63,3,2014,,Articles,ART,,1,Vera,Eory,Michael,MacLeod,Shailesh,Shrestha,David,Roberts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,562_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Determining Short Term Responses of Irish Dairy Farms under Climate Change,en_US,"This study aimed to determine short term farm responses of Irish dairy farms under climate change. The Irish National Farm Survey data and Irish weather data were the main datasets used in this study. A set of simulation models were used to determine grass yields and field time under a baseline scenario and a future climate scenario. An optimising farm level model which maximises farm net income under limiting farm resources was then run under these scenarios. Changes in farm net incomes under the climate change scenario compared to the baseline scenario were taken as a measure to determine the effect of climate change on farms. Any changes in farm activities under the climate run compared to the baseline run were considered as farm’s responses to maximise farm profits. The results showed that there was a substantial increase in yields of grass (49% to 56%) in all regions. The impact of climate change on farms was different based on the regions. Dairy farms in the Border, Midlands and South East regions suffered whereas dairy farms in other regions generally fared better under the climate change scenario. For a majority of farms, a substitution of concentrate feed with grass based feeds and increasing stocking rate were identified as the most common farm responses. However, farms replaced concentrate feed at varying degree. Dairy farms in the Mid East showed a move towards beef production system where medium dairy farms in the South East regions shifted entire tillage land to grass land. Farms in the South East region also kept animals on grass longer under the climate change scenario compared to the baseline scenario.",,,,,2014-09-01,63,3,2014,,Articles,ART,,2,Shailesh,Shrestha,Thia,Hennessy,Mohamed,Abdalla,Dermot,Forristal,Michael B.,Jones,,,,,,,,,,,,,563_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Integrated Analysis of Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Measures in Austrian Agriculture,en_US,"An integrated modelling framework (IMF) has been developed and applied to analyse climate change impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation measures in Austrian agriculture. The IMF couples the crop rotation model CropRota, the bio-physical process model EPIC and the bottom-up economic land use model PASMA at regional level (NUTS-3) considering agrienvironmental indicators. Four contrasting regional climate model (RCM) simulations represent climate change until 2050. The RCM simulations are applied to a baseline and three adaptation and policy scenarios. Climate change increases crop productivity on national average in the IMF. Changes in average gross margins at national level range from 0% to +5% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. The impacts at NUTS-3 level range from -5% to +7% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. Adaptation measures such as planting of winter cover crops, reduced tillage and irrigation are effective in reducing yield losses, increasing revenues, or in improving environmental states under climate change. Future research should account for extreme weather events in order to analyse whether average productivity gains at the aggregated level suffice to cover costs from expected higher climate variability.",,,,,2014-09-01,63,3,2014,,Articles,ART,,3,Martin,Schönhart,Hermine,Mitter,Erwin,Schmid,Georg,Heinrich,Andreas,Gobiet,,,,,,,,,,,,,564_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Income Impacts of Climate Change: Irrigated Farming in the Mediterranean and Expected Changes in Probability of Favorable and Adverse Weather Conditions,en_US,"EU rural development policy (RDP) regulation 1305/2013 aims to protect farmers’ incomes from ongoing change of climate variability (CCV), and the increase in frequency of adverse climatic events. An income stabilization tool (IST) is provided to compensate drastic drops in income, including those caused by climatic events. The present study examines some aspect of its application focussing on Mediterranean irrigation area where frequent water shortages may generate significant income reductions in the current climate conditions, and may be further exacerbated by climate change. This enhanced loss of income in the future would occur due to a change in climate variability. This change would appreciably reduce the probability of weather conditions that are favourable for irrigation, but would not significantly increase either the probability of unfavourable weather conditions or the magnitude of their impact.

,The Impact of Payment Entitlements on Arable Land Prices and Rental Rates in Schleswig-Holstein,en_US,"This paper investigates the impact of payment entitlements traded in conjunction with farmland on the prices and rental rates of arable land. The empirical analysis is based upon a survey of land rental and land purchase contracts concluded in Schleswig-Holstein between 2005 and 2011. Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of plot attributes, farm characteristics, regional and macroeconomic factors on arable land purchase prices and rental rates. The simultaneous transfer of payment entitlements enters the models as an additional explanatory variable. The observation period is sub-divided into two phases to account for the potentially differential impact of payment entitlements before (until 2009) and during the gliding phase (2010 and after). The sample comprises 135 land purchase contracts and 213 land rental agreements. The results show that rental rates for arable land in Schleswig-Holstein, besides being influenced by other factors, are significantly higher when a payment entitlement is traded with the land. The price-increasing effect is estimated to be on average 30-35 % of the payment entitlements’ nominal value at the time of contract conclusion. The analysis does not reveal a statistically significant impact of payment entitlements on the purchase price of arable land.",,,,,2014-12-01,63,4,2014,,Articles,ART,,1,Solveigh,Hennig,Gunnar,Breustedt,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,572_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Do Farmers Consider the Effects on Financial Flexibility when Making their Investment Decisions?,en_US,"for adaption processes which often involve leveraged investments that, in turn, cause decreasing equity capital ratios of farms. It is, therefore, possible that financial flexibility - as the farm’s debt capacity - will also decrease. The question arises to what extent decision makers consider the effects on the financial flexibility of the individual farm when making their investment decisions. In the present study, farmers are faced with hypothetical investment alternatives in a discrete choice experiment. The investment alternatives presented to the farmers differ in their profitability, risk and effect on the financial flexibility of the individual farm. The results show that financial flexibility is relevant in their investment decisions. The importance farmers attach to the financial flexibility depends, among others, on their risk attitude and the profitability of the farm.",,,,,2014-12-01,63,4,2014,,Articles,ART,,2,Friederike,Anastassiadis,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,573_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Are Agri-food Exports any Special? Exchange Rate Nonlinearities in European Exports to the US,en_US,"Using aggregated EMU exports to the US as an example, VERHEYEN (2013a) showed, that in the long run exports react to exchange rate changes in a nonlinear way. This paper tests whether this holds true for agri-food exports as well. To address this question a partial sum decomposition approach and the NARDL framework of SHIN et al. (2013) is applied to the aggregated agri-food exports of eleven European countries to the US, which is currently the major partner of the EU in agricultural trade. The outcomes suggest, that the exchange rate nonlinearities are even more pronounced in agri-food than in total exports. European exporters seem to benefit more from Euro depreciation, than its appreciation harms them. These findings might be interpreted as a sign of pricing strategies application (e.g., pricing-to-market) to the European agri-food exports.",,,,,2014-12-01,63,4,2014,,Articles,ART,,3,Svetlana,Fedoseeva,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,574_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,A New Graphical User Interface Generator for Economic Models and its Comparison to Existing Approaches,en_US,"The paper discusses the role of Graphical User Inter-faces in economic modelling and specifically the de-velopment of a new Graphical User Interface Genera-tor for applications realized in GAMS (General Alge-braic Modelling System), a widely used Algebraic Modelling Language for (bio-)economic simulation models. It motivates the development of GGIG (Gams Graphical Interface Generator) by reviewing existing approaches. In opposite to frameworks available for environmental and Agent Based Modelling, GUI ge-nerators for more classical economic models seem to be scarce. GGIG aims at a fast development process not requiring programming skills where simple user operable controls are defined in an XML file such that GAMS based projects can add easily a GUI. It com-prises quite versatile exploitation tools for interactive reporting (tables, graphs and maps) including a ma-chine learning package plus useful utilities, e.g. to generate a HTML based GAMS code documentation or batch execution. In opposite to other approaches, GGIG strictly separates the GUI and GAMS code, but does not offer IDE functionality. Applications to CAPRI, a rather complex model, and some smaller projects seem to show that researchers without formal programming training are able to develop and modify a GUI for their models, while model users can be quickly trained in GGIG based GUIs.",,,,,2014-12-01,63,4,2014,,Articles,ART,,4,Wolfgang,Britz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,575_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Investment Behavior of Organic and Conventional Pig Farmers in Germany – An Experimental Approach,en_US,"Despite the economic benefits of organic farming, the conversion rates to this production method are low. The reasons for this reluctance are largely unknown. We experimentally investigate and compare the investment behavior of organic and conventional pig farmers and examine the question whether the investment behavior changes ceteris paribus due to a varying framing – different description – of an investment possibility with organic or conventional farming. Our results show that pig farmers are more reluctant to invest in the production method which they are not currently applying compared to an investment in the production method in use on their farm. Conventional, risk-averse pig farmers and farmers who holding a university degree invest later in a hog barn. The results provide some evidence for that the effect of subsidies granted to encourage the conversion to organic farming is overestimated.",,,,,2015-02-28,64,1,2015,,Articles,ART,,1,Daniel,Hermann,Katrin,Agethen,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,587_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Evaluating the Land Conversion of Annual Crop Production to Cultivate Miscanthus – An Application of the Real Options Approach,en_US,"Several studies applying the classical investment theory have shown that miscanthus (MSC) is an economically advantageous alternative to traditional agricultural land use. Nevertheless, only few farmers cultivate MSC. Therefore, it seems as if farmers do not act according to classical investment theory. In contrast to the classical investment theory, the real options approach (ROA) considers irreversibility and temporal flexibility of an investment as well as uncertainty with regard to investment returns. Consequently, investment triggers indicating when a decision-maker should invest can be shifted upwards in comparison to the classical investment theory. It is therefore often concluded that the ROA can help to explain investment restraint. However, the possibility of disinvestment is often neglected. Thus, there is the risk that calculated investment triggers of the ROA are overestimated. We develop a model by using a combination of a genetic algorithm and stochastic simulation in order to calculate investment triggers in general, and conversion triggers in particular (with and without reconversion possibilities) to the conversion possibility from wheat to MSC following the ROA. Our results show that the conversion triggers of the ROA are higher than those of the classical investment theory. Nevertheless, the neglection of disinvestment (reconversion) possibilities leads to overestimating conversion triggers. However, conversion triggers of the ROA are still higher than those of the classical conversion triggers of both theories decrease. It can be concluded that the ROA has the potential to partially explain farmers' inertia to convert to MSC.",,,,,2015-02-28,64,1,2015,,Articles,ART,,2,Antonius,Diekmann,Matthias,Haverkamp,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,588_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Estimation of the Willingness to Pay for CO2 Savings – A Discrete Choice Experiment,en_US,"In this article the willingness to pay for different methods to save carbon dioxide emissions in northern Germany are examined by a Discrete Choice Experiment. The results of a latent-class estimation show, that the respondents could be disposed into four different classes. The membership to a certain class is mostly determined by the age and the common preferences for climate protection of the respondents. All respondents have the highest preference to save CO2 emissions by CO2-certificates, the lowest preferences exist for the carbon dioxide capture and storage method. The results vary between a willingness to pay for saving CO2 emissions of 644 €/t and a willingness to accept a certain method for a compensation of 161 €/t carbon dioxide.",,,,,2015-06-01,64,2,2015,,Articles,ART,,1,Thore,Holm-Müller,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,Jens-Peter,Loy,Norbert,Schulz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,599_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Risk Reduction Potential of Weather Index-based Insurance in Agribusiness – The Importance of the Aggregation Level of Yield Time Series,en_US,"Weather index-based insurance is not sufficiently used in agriculture as of yet. Basis risks are considered to be a major reason for this. By the use of weather in-dex-based insurance, basis risks remain with the farmer. However, weather index-based insurance can be interesting for agribusiness companies, specifically those which aggregate yields of several farms amongst themselves. This paper investigates the importance of the aggregation level of yield time series for the hedg-ing effectiveness of weather index-based insurance following the example of a sugar processing company. This investigation is based on empirical sugar beet yield data from 40 sugar beet producing farms in Northern Germany. Furthermore, we work with the aggregated sugar yield time series of roughly 5,000 farms, which account for sugar beets used in the sugar processing company in question. At the same time, this highly aggregated yield time series de-scribes the quantity risk of the sugar processing com-pany. Our results empirically show that in conse-quence of aggregating the sugar yield time series, basis risk is diminished and risk reduction potential is raised through the use of weather index-based insur-ance. The risk reduction potential of weather index-based insurance can, therefore, be underestimated if it is derived from studies pertaining to yield time series at the individual farm level. The focus of the present study may be relevant for agribusiness companies, as well as for potential providers of weather derivatives.",,,,,2015-06-01,64,2,2015,,Articles,ART,,2,Niels,Pelka,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,600_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Do Different Measurements of Soil Quality Influence the Results of a Ricardian Analysis? – A Case Study on the Effects of Climate Change on German Agriculture,en_US,"This study assesses the potential impact of future climate change on agricultural land rents in Germany using a Ricardian approach. In addition to including common explanatory variables, we focus on the effects of different indicators of soil characteristics when explaining land rental prices. The analysis is based on data from the official farm census 1999, weather data from the German National Meteorological Service and different soil data-bases at the county level. Different classifications of soil quality do not influence the results of our Ricardian analysis. The results of spatial error models indicate higher land rental prices for locations with more productive soils and higher mean annual temperatures. Also a lower land slope, a smaller share of rented land and (in some cases) less spring precipitation increase land rental prices. To estimate the effects of changing climatic conditions on future land rents, we draw on data from the regional climate model REMO for 2011-2040. Our models show an average land rent increase of 10-17% resulting from the expected changes in temperature and spring precipitation. According to our results future climate change will have an overall positive but spatially heterogeneous impact on the agricultural income in Germany.",,,,,2015-06-01,64,2,2015,,Articles,ART,,3,Eva,Schmidtner,Stephan,Dabbert,Christian,Lippert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,606_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Analyzing Results from Agricultural Large-scale Economic Simulation Models: Recent Progress and the Way Ahead,en_US,"This article discusses the role of post model pro-cessing and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in the context of applying large and complex economic simulation models for Impact Assessment (IA) of policies impacting the agricultural and food sectors. The calculation of indicators from different domains and decomposition approaches is presented as part of post-processing of model results. We review user roles with regard to the application of complex economic models in agricultural IA, concluding that the GUIs will be mostly used by experienced analysts. The article stresses the role of GUIs in separating the code implementation of the economic model from the presentation of their results for analytical purposes. It highlights core functionalities of GUIs based on a detailed comparison between the GUIs and post-model analysis tools of three large economic models: Aglink-Cosimo, CAPRI and GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project). Whereas the Aglink-Cosimo and CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact Modelling System) models follow a strict separation between model and data analysis software tools, the GTAP model follows a model integrated approach using GEMPACK (General Equilibrium Modelling Package) tools. Moreover, the CAPRI GUI is technically and formally detached from the data generation process. Aglink-Cosimo and GTAP models use tools specifically developed to serve mainly their own needs (and tailored to communicate with their model drivers). One specific characteristic of Aglink-Cosimo relates to the need of interactive documentation for users due to the declarative nature of the code, which relies upon the obligation of the OECD and FAO to deliver a transparent and well-documented model and data-base to a formalized group of users. The CAPRI and GTAP models are much more research-driven and therefore have invested more resources in building bridges with other model consortia. We conclude that an integrated GUI would benefit from combining the best features of the different approaches presented.",,,,,2015-06-01,64,2,2015,,Articles,ART,,4,Wolfgang,Britz,Ignacio,Pérez-Dominguez,Gopalakrishnan Badri,Narayanan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,602_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Citizens’ Evaluation of Animal Welfare on Pictures of Intensive Broiler Fattening: A Survey Experiment,en_US,"Based on media discussion about animal production systems and animal welfare in Germany that mainly relies on pictures, this study analyses the citizen perception of intensive broiler fattening. In a survey experiment, five pictures from a 40,000 broiler barn were shown to citizens. The pictures were taken in the same barn but vary in age of the animals and stocking densities. The sample was split to avoid the five pictures from influencing the perception and each participant was shown only one picture. Overall, the evaluation of the pictures was very negative. Only the picture showing day-old-chicks was perceived as favorable (stocking density: 0.8 kg/m²). This is a challenge for the communication of animal welfare standards because the reductions, inter alia currently being discussed in science and politics of stocking densities were not perceived as an animal welfare advantage from a citizen perspective.",,,,,2015-09-01,64,3,2015,,Articles,ART,,1,Gesa,Busch,Carolin,Schwetje,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,607_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Intensification Plans of Austrian Farmers beyond Dairy Quotas – An Empirical Model to Explain Planned Behaviour,en_US,"This article analyses intensification plans of Austrian dairy farmers after the abolition of the EU milk quota regime in 2015. Binary logistic regression models have been developed using survey data (N = 455) on farmers’ values, believes, expectations, and plans. The models are tested on its ability to predict intensification plans in dairy production. The results indicate that midterm plans are mainly determined by farmers’ attitudes towards own behaviour as well as perceptions on behavioural control. Orientation towards farm enlargement and optimistic perceptions on management options after the abolition of the milk quota in 2015 are preconditions for intensification plans even if farm succession strategies are already settled and farm resource endowments are seen sufficient.",,,,,2015-09-01,64,3,2015,,Articles,ART,,2,Manuela,Larcher,Martin,Schönhart,Erwin,Schmid,Stefan,Vogel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,609_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Short Term Prediction of Agricultural Structural Change using Farm Accountancy Data Network and Farm Structure Survey Data,en_US,"The prediction of farm structural change is of large interest at EU policy level, but available methods are limited regarding the joint and consistent use of available data sources. This paper develops a Bayesian Markov framework for short-term prediction of farm numbers that allows combining two asynchronous data sources in a single estimation. Specifically, the approach allows combining aggregated Farm Structure Survey (FSS) macro data, available every two to three years, with individual farm level Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) micro data, available on a yearly basis. A Bayesian predictive distribution is derived from which point predictions such as mean and other moments are obtained. The proposed approach is evaluated in an out-of-sample prediction exercise of farm numbers in German regions and compared to linear and geometric predic-tion as well as a “no-change” prediction of farm numbers. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms the geometric prediction but does not significantly improve upon the linear prediction and a prediction of no change in this context.",,,,,2015-09-01,64,3,2015,,Articles,ART,,3,Hugo,Storm,Thomas,Heckelei,María,Espinosa,Sergio,Gomez y Paloma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,610_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Does Spatial Dependence Depend on Spatial Resolution? – An Empirical Analysis of Organic Farming in Southern Germany,en_US,"Assuming that agglomeration effects do matter in organic farming we analyse (a) the difficulties due to data aggregation arising when trying to statistically verify neighbourhood effects and (b) whether results can be confirmed at different spatial resolutions. Explaining the spatial distribution of organic farming in southern Germany (2007) we compare results of spatial lag models at two measurement scales. The results suggest that essential factors determining the decision to convert from conventional to organic farming are found at different spatial resolutions. The results at the lower spatial resolution are not artificially generated through the aggregation process in this case, strengthening the relevance of previous studies.",,,,,2015-09-01,64,3,2015,,Articles,ART,,4,Eva,Schmidtner,Christian,Lippert,Stephan,Dabbert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,611_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Political Economy of Biotechnology,en_US,"The introduction of GE to agriculture has encoun-tered strong resistance, reflecting conflicting groups within and between countries. This has resulted in a regulatory environment that has limited the application of GE mostly to feed and fiber and practically restricted its application in food. While agricultural biotechnology has already provided significant benefits, much of its potential has not been reached. Regulation of agricultural biotechnology reflects conflicting interests and varying political power of different groups. The relatively supportive regulation of biotechnology in the U.S. reflects that it is an American technology, and supporting groups like the farm lobby, technology manufacturers, and U.S. consumers outweigh the objections of environmentalists and other opposition to the technology. In Europe, growing concern about environmental side-effects of agriculture, the fact that GE technology was imported, and the power of environmental groups has resulted in restrictive regulation. To a large extent, the fate of GE depends on the level of goodwill it generates among voters, and as long as a large segment of the population is apprehensive about its benefits, heavy restrictions about the technology that prevent it from reaching its potential will persist.",,,,,2015-12-01,64,4,2015,,Articles,ART,,2,David,Zilbermann,Gregory,Graff,Gal,Hochmann,Scott,Kaplan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,616_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Political Economy of Fostering a Wood-based Bioeconomy in Germany,en_US,"To increase the sustainability of economic processes and products as well as the use of sustainable resource inputs, a transition is required from the hitherto predominantly fossil resource-based “throughput economy” towards a circular flow economy based on renewable resources, the so-called bioeconomy. This paper considers the transition challenge from the perspective of dynamic theories on lock-in effects and lock-out options. Within this framework, a successful transition requires a twofold equilibrium: the economic sustainability equilibrium and a corresponding political equilibrium providing the corresponding transition policies. Based on the positive analysis of both current bioeconomy policies and policy demand by bioeconomy actors in Germany, this paper devel-ops recommendations on how a political equilibrium may be achieved which favors a sustainability-oriented transformation to a bioeconomy. One means of doing so, for example, is to combine a gradual development of existing policies with efforts to identify and support innovative niche products and processes.",,,,,2015-12-01,64,4,2015,,Articles,ART,,3,Nadine,Pannicke,Erik,Gawel,Nina,Hagemann,Alexandra,Purkus,Sebastian,Strunz,,,,,,,,,,,,,617_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

After the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has given a favourable opinion on the safety of a GE crop, the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) votes on the application. If the SCFCAH reaches no decision, the Appeal Committee (AC) (pre the Treaty of Lisbon: the Council) votes on the application; if no decision is reached here, the final decision is left to the European Commission. All EU Member States (MSs) are represented on both committees; decisions are made by a qualified majority (QM) voting system, the rules of which have changed over time. Our data include 50 events; and 61 ballots at the SCFCAH and 57 ballots at the Council / AC. A QM has been achieved once only at the SCFCAH, but never at Council. At Council / AC level, Austria and Croatia have consistently voted against an approval, while The Netherlands has always supported approvals. All other MSs showed differences in their voting decisions at the SCFCAH and Council / AC level at least once. MS-fixed-effects are the major factors explaining the voting results supporting the gridlock hypothesis, while crop characteristics and crop use play no apparent role in MSs' voting behaviour. We maintain that a QM is unlikely following the latest directive for MSs to ‘opt-out’ on GE crop cultivation in their territories.",,,,,2015-12-01,64,4,2015,,Articles,ART,,4,Richard D.,Smart,Matthias,Blum,Justus,Wesseler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,618_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Public Debate on Biofuels in Germany: Who Drives the Discourse?,en_US,"Following the European Commission’s concept of a “Knowledge-based Bioeconomy” (KBBE), great significance in the process of political decision-making shall be attached to scientific expertise. In contrast, the conducted print media analysis on the German biofuel discourse for the period from 1995 to 2012 only found a marginal role of scientific actors in the debate. Even though support for biofuels has been largely rejected as inefficient by several scientific brain trusts for many years, the German government, as well as the EU adhere to this policy. This raises the question of the underlying interests that drive the persistent support for biofuels. In this context, the paper investigates the standing and positioning of different actors in the public media and thereby it contributes to a better understanding of why the political support for biofuels is continued, despite the doubts of scientists.  One of the core findings of the study states, that one reason for this political support can be seen in the dominance of a coalition of biofuel advocates, mainly formed by political and economic actors, in the public discourse.",,,,,2015-12-01,64,4,2015,,Articles,ART,,5,Judith,Puttkammer,Harald,Grethe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,619_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Biofuel Sustainability Requirements – The Case of Rapeseed Biodiesel,en_US,"Biodiesel production in Europe and Germany relies heavily on rapeseed oil. Thus, the biodiesel industry has become the most important outlet for rapeseed oil. In light of the increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) saving requirements at the European level, this situation may change: according to the default values specified in the current legislation, biodiesel produced from rapeseed oil will not meet GHG saving requirements as of 2017. In this article, we assess the market impacts of the withdrawal of rapeseed oil from the biodiesel industry in Germany and Europe. Simulations with the MAGNET and CAPRI modelling systems indicate a decline in producer prices for rapeseed of approximately 17% in the EU. The area dedicated to rapeseed production will decline by 6%. Rapeseed oil is primarily substituted by imported vegetable oils. Simultaneously, imports of biodiesel from North America, Argentina and Asia are projected to increase. We investigate options to improve the GHG balance of rapeseed biodiesel. We conclude that only a combination of climate-friendly produced fertiliser and efficient conversion processes can provide the necessary GHG emission-savings to meet the EU’s sustainability goals after 2017.",,,,,2015-12-01,64,4,2015,,Articles,ART,,6,Franziska,Junker,Alexander,Gocht,Sandra,Marquardt,Bernhard,Osterburg,Heinz,Stichnothe,,,,,,,,,,,,,620_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,What Influences the Growth of Organic Farms? Evidence from a Panel of Organic Farms in Germany,en_US,"Organic farming is one of the fastest-growing branches of agriculture in Germany. The net increase in the number of hectares comes partly from the conversion of conventional farms, but also in part from the acreage expansion of existing organic farms. So far, empirical research has focused on analysing conversion to organic farming, and lately on reversion to conventional farming. However, changes in individual organic farm sizes have remained ignored by empirical researchers. Additionally, the occurrence and the extent of farm growth are largely dependent on the regional conditions of land market, farm structure and policy measures. Therefore, it remains unclear what other factors besides increasing demand for organic products might influence growth of organic farms. The main objective in this study is to determine whether organic farms are changing their scale of operation and, if so, which factors contribute to – or stagnate – farm growth and to what extent. To answer these questions we analyse growth in a unique panel dataset of 453 farms over the 1993-2005 period using the system generalised method of moments estimator (SGMM). The results reveal that all farms increase area by a maximum of 10 ha and large farms change farm size more frequently than smaller ones. Increases in organic area are influenced by subsidies for organic farming and intensity of livestock production. Farm growth measured in terms of output is affected by farm size, land, capital, soil quality, and intensity of livestock production.",,,,,2016-02-29,65,1,2016,,Articles,ART,,1,Thelma,Brenes-Muñoz,Sebastian,Lakner,Bernhard,Brümmer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,628_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Optimizing Inspection Strategies to Enforce  Organic Farming Standards,en_US,"The organic market depends on an effective and efficient certification system. Control bodies or authorities are pivotal to this system. From a social point of view, our objective is to theoretically optimize inspection strategies. For this, sanctions and inspection frequencies have to be implemented in a way that the net social damage arising from farmers’ non-compliance with an organic standard will be minimized. In scenarios that combine different kinds of social damages, fines and compliance cost distributions for an assumed set of farms we use Monte Carlo simulations to model farmers’ non-compliance and resulting social damages. Depending on potential reputation losses and compliance cost variability among farms we identify different adequate control frequencies.",,,,,2016-02-29,65,1,2016,,Articles,ART,,2,Christian,Lippert,Alexander,Zorn,Stephan,Dabbert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,629_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Planting Rights Liberalization in the European Union: An Analysis of the Possible Effects on the Wine Sector in Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany",en_US,"This study investigates the effects of planting rights liberalization on the largest wine-producing region in Germany, Rheinland-Pfalz. Introduced by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) in 2008, the abolishment of restrictions on the planting of new vineyards is still a subject of controversial discussions regarding possible effects on the sector’s structure and the quantity of wine production. For a simulation of these effects, this study uses partial equilibrium modeling and Markov chain projection. The results reveal that the effects of abolishment of planting rights depend on the assumed wine must prices. Relatively high market prices for wine must would lead to increases in the production of both standard and basic quality wine must and in the number of more cost-effective wine farms in the region. If low prices for wine must are assumed, the reform might result only in minor impacts.",,,,,2016-02-29,65,1,2016,,Articles,ART,,3,Mariia,Bogonos,Barbara,Engler,Jürgen,Oberhofer,Marc,Dreßler,Stephan,Dabbert,,,,,,,,,,,,,630_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Is the Cultivation of Sugar Beets as a Biogas Substrate an Alternative for Farmers? A Discrete Choice Experiment for the Design of Substrate-supply-contracts for Sugar Beets,en_US,"In order to provide a sustainable renewable energy production in biogas plants, it is necessary to examine substrates apart from silage maize on their suitability and acceptance in society. In this context, sugar beets gain more and more importance for the production of biogas. To date, there have not been any studies on the attitude of farmers towards the alternative use of sugar beets in biogas plants. We, therefore, investigated how substrate supply contracts should be designed that farmers agree to cultivate sugar beets for biogas. Due to the lack of farm-level data, we conducted an online-survey including a Discrete Choice Experiment with 118 German farmers. Our results show that the participating farmers react with re-straint to contract sugar beets for biogas. If farmers opt for a supply contract of beet as biogas substrate, they prefer a short contract period and small-scale cultivation. A spring harvest of sugar beets is generally rejected.",,,,,2016-02-29,65,1,2016,,Articles,ART,,4,Saramena,Sauthoff,Friederike,Anastassiadis,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,631_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Observable Raw Milk Prices: Chance for Dairy Farmers – Risk for Final Consumers,en_US,"Whether observable raw milk prices are more likely to increase or decrease the economic situation of dairy farmers is in dispute. Using a game-theoretic model, we show that observable raw milk prices can be restrictive and profitable for dairies if the tendency towards concentration in the dairy sector persists. Whereas observable raw milk prices open a chance for dairy farmers to receive a higher producer surplus, they carry a risk for final consumers to receive a lower consumer surplus. In particular, we argue about cooperatives because they are predominant in the dairy sector. Our findings can be generalized to other organizational forms in the dairy sector because similar organizational structures are established by long-term contracts.",,,,,2016-02-29,65,1,2016,,Articles,ART,,5,Andreas,Hildenbrand,Rainer,Kühl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,632_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Direct Payments in Germany – Income and Distributional Effects of the 2013 CAP Reform,en_US,"One of the objectives of the 2013 CAP Reform was to improve the distribution of direct income support among farmers by redesigning first pillar payments. In Germany the related discussions led to the political decision to allocate a part of the respective budget to provide extra support for smaller farms. This paper analyses the impacts of the 2013 CAP reform for two scenarios of alternative direct payment schemes, with a specific focus on the distributional effects of the new components of the first pillar. Results on the basis of the farm accountancy data network indicate that overall direct payments reduce income inequality, while the effects differ significantly between the different payment schemes. The redistributive payment (support for the so-called 'first hectares') is almost equally distributed among farms, however due to the small budget allocated the impact on the distribution of income is limited. Compared to the situation before the policy change, the 2013 CAP reform and its national implementation in Germany slightly reduce the inequality of the distribution of direct payments, but do not reduce income inequality. A full utilization of the scope for the redistributive payment could have slightly reduced income inequality, but, due to the limited correlation of land endowment and income level, would not constitute an efficient distributive policy instrument either.",,,,,2016-06-01,65,2,2016,,Articles,ART,,1,Heiko,Hansen,Frank,Offermann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,641_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Identification of Factors Influencing the Use of Slurry Solids as Fermentation Substrate in Biogas Plants,en_US,"Due to meanwhile high prices on agricultural markets and new legislation, more and more biogas plant operators are faced with the challenge of operating their plants economically and in line with the existing legal framework. Against this background, the search for alternative fermentation substrates has been intensified. Because of this development and the increasing problems of nutrient surpluses in regions characterized by high livestock densities, slurry solids have increasingly been taken into consideration as fermentation substrates. So far there has been very little knowledge about biogas plant operators’ willingness to accept solids from slurry separation as fermentation substrates. To close this research gap, this study empirically identifies determinants of plant operators’ willingness to use slurry solids. The research framework is a model inspired by the Technology Acceptance Model 2 by VENKATESH and DAVIS (2000). For data analysis, the partial least squares method (PLS) was used. The results show that the operators are generally interested in slurry solids but only a few are actually willing to use this substrate. 53 % of the intention to use manure solids and 68 % of the usage behavior could be explained by the model. Important decision criteria are the costs, the legal environment as well as the biogas plant operators’ risk attitudes and openness for innovations.",,,,,2016-06-01,65,2,2016,,Articles,ART,,2,Rhena,Kröger,Jan Robert,Konerding,Ludwig,Theuvsen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,643_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Do High-quality Wines Capture Higher Prices? A Hedonic Price Analysis on DLG Quality Tests,en_US,"With data from the Quality Tests by Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft (DLG) for wine, i.e. Deutsche Bundesweinprämierung, we analyze to what extent quality awards lead to higher wine prices. The empirical analysis reveals that DLG Awards in Silver, Gold and Gold Extra are associated with statistically significant price premia. Apparently, a successful participation in the Quality Tests raises consumers’ marginal willingness to pay for a wine and producers may realize higher net prices. It is crucial here how quality is communicated to buyers in the decision-making process. Price premia due to DLG awards suggest that it is more important to establish a reputation over time than just signaling quality by showing award labels on the bottle. The quantitative results show that quality grades, regional origin, grape variety, wine style and sweetness are further product characteristics that strongly affect wine prices due to their impacts on winegrowers’ marginal costs and/or on consumer preferences.",,,,,2016-06-01,65,2,2016,,Articles,ART,,3,Isabel,Schäufele,Roland,Herrmann,Gergely,Szolnoki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,644_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Determinants of Consumers’ Willingness-to-pay for Fairly-produced, Locally Grown Dairy Products",en_US,"At the end of the last decade, several regional marketing projects were launched in the dairy sectors of various Alpine countries with the aim of creating a higher added value for milk products and allowing fair prices for the dairy farmers involved. The projects wanted to offer an alternative marketing channel for the farms in these regions by marketing ‘fairly-produced, locally grown products’. The aim of this study is to analyze the determinants of consumers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for fairly-produced, locally grown products using two different WTP measures: the first one describes a more general willingness-to-pay (WTPGEN) and the second one quantifies the price premium (WTPQUAN) respondents are willing to pay. The influence of both person-related and environmental factors, which are known to have an impact on food-related consumption behavior, was determined introducing and using the Shapley value (SV) decomposition of R2. This concept is commonly used in the commercial marketing context, but until now it has rarely been applied in academic research on food-related consumption behavior, even though it provides interesting advantages. The results show that consumers’ WTP for fairly-produced, locally grown products is influenced by person-related factors as well as by environmental factors. In the case of WTPQUAN, a dominant influence by consumers’ price consciousness can be observed, while a higher relative importance of the more global constructs of norms, stated preferences, and values can be detected when ex-plaining WTPGEN.",,,,,2016-06-01,65,2,2016,,Articles,ART,,4,Agnes,Emberger-Klein,Klaus,Menrad,Dominik,Heider,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,642_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Use of Silage Maize for Biogas Production – A Spatial Econometric Approach,en_US,"The expansion of silage maize production has experienced a dynamic development in recent years. This happened against the background of continuously decreasing cattle numbers and a rapid increase in biogas production. Available information on actual cultivated land with silage maize for biogas production in Germany diverges due to different methods of calculation between 500 000 ha and 1 800 000 ha for the year 2010. Based on the spatial econometric models developed in this study, estimates of the use of silage maize in biogas production and dairy and cattle farming are given for the state of Bavaria. The average estimated share of silage maize of agricultural land in Bavaria is 4.5 % for biogas production and 7.2 % for dairy and cattle farming. About 40 % of total production of silage maize is used for energy purposes on average. Further, the results of the study allow for a spatially differentiated view on the use of silage maize for biogas production.",,,,,2016-09-01,65,3,2016,,Articles,ART,,1,Lukas,Scholz,Andreas,Meyer-Aurich,Dieter,Kirschke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,650_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Consumer Understanding of the Terms Alpine Milk and Pasture-raised Milk,en_US,"In recent years in the course of product differentiation more and more dairy products have been introduced promising additional benefits for consumers. The present article analyses the consumers’ understanding of the products alpine milk and pasture-raised milk by means of two empirical studies. Currently, both product designations are legally unprotected terms. Therefore, producers and marketers implement the labelling with very different product concepts. Against this background it is empirically analysed how consumers understand alpine milk and pasture-raised milk. Do consumers think that cows giving the milk for alpine milk are kept in a certain geographical region? And does pasture-raised milk mean to them that dairy cattle have access to pasture and if yes during which period? The results of the case studies show that consumer expectations with respect to products which are advertised with unobservable process characteristics are very high which could lead to consumer disappointment.",,,,,2016-09-01,65,3,2016,,Articles,ART,,2,Ramona,Weinrich,Sarah,Kühl,Anke,Zühlsdorf,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,651_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Risk Attitude and Risk Perception of Dairy Farmers in Austria,en_US,"Risk management measures to ensure successful strategic planning and long-term income stabilization are becoming increasingly important for agricultural enterprises. Dealing with risks and the willingness to pay for risk management measures are highly dependent on individual attitude towards and perception of risk. Against this background, the present paper examines the risk attitude and perception of Austrian farmers using dairy production as an example. The data consists of an online survey of 109 dairy producers. The results show that the producers' attitude – various psychological (self-assessment, business-  related statements) and economic methods (Holt-and-Laury Lottery) were applied – is prevalent risk neutral. The measurement of subjective risk perception shows that Austrian dairy farmers are concerned with policy and market risks.",,,,,2016-12-01,65,4,2016,,Articles,ART,,1,Markus,Scharner,Siegfried,Pöchtrager,Manuela,Larcher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,657_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Transportation in Pig Husbandry: Does an Increase in Consumers’ Information and Knowledge Lead to a More Positive Attitude?,en_US,"In the European Union, and Germany in particular, the transport of livestock is an essential step in the meat production process. Pig transport especially, has frequently been the focus of public interest. In the last several decades, awareness for animal welfare has grown in society, which has often led to negative attitudes from the public towards farm animal husbandry and transportation. It is a well-known fact that a person’s knowledge and his/her attitude are strongly linked. Thus far, the connection between knowledge and attitude with regards to the transport of farm animals, especially pigs, has not been scientifically examined. In an online survey taken by 272 German consumers the effect that additional information in the form of written texts and pictures on public perception was examined. The results of this study reveal that this additional information does have a positive effect on the respondents’ attitudes, yet consumer attitudes remain rather negative.",,,,10.30430/66.2017.1.1-12,2017-03-01,66,1,2017,,Articles,ART,,1,Stefan Clemens,Wille,Gesa,Busch,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,666_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Productivity Change of Arable Farms with Regard to Greenhouse Gas Emissions,en_US,"This study analyses the environmental efficiency and changes in productivity of arable farms, taking greenhouse gas emissions into consideration as an undesirable output. Shadow prices of greenhouse gas emissions and determinants of efficiency are investigated and the influence of different sources of productivity change is quantified. The methodological framework is based on output-oriented and enhanced hyperbolic stochastic distance functions. The balanced data panel comprises 141 arable farms located in northern Germany between the 2002/03 and 2009/10 financial years. The results show that there are potential savings of 12% or 9% of product-related emissions for the output-oriented and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions, respectively. Better soil quality and a higher proportion of grain and sugar beet in the crop rotation influence efficiency positively. In contrast, a higher percentage of organic fertilizer and a higher percentage of outsourced services have a negative influence on efficiency. Average shadow prices of greenhouse gas emissions are, depending on the distance function, from €3.56 to €7.12 per tonne CO2 equivalent and from €1.71 to €3.41 per tonne CO2 equivalent. Shadow prices show an increasing trend during the observation period. The determined positive productivity change is mainly caused by technical progress. Average efficiency changes have only a marginal impact on productivity change. Scale changes inhibit productivity progress slightly.",,,,,2017-03-01,66,1,2017,,Articles,ART,,2,Patrick J.C.,Wettemann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,668_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Reversion from Organic to Conventional Agriculture in Germany: An Event History Analysis,en_US,"Organic farming has become increasingly important during recent decades, and the increasing number of organic farms shows a positive trend. Recent studies, however, find that there is a counterbalancing trend: farmers are leaving the organic sector and reverting to conventional methods. We contribute to this new branch of literature by performing event history analysis in order to examine reversion patterns in Germany for the first time. Moreover, we present new evidence for a comparable cohort of farms on which organic production was started in the same time period between 1999 and 2003. Our results show that 30% of these newly converted farms were reverted to conventional agriculture by 2010. Most of the reversions took place between 2003 to 2005. Thus, we can conclude that these farms were reverted within six years after they had become organic. Furthermore, we find that part-time farms and farms with fattened pigs or poultry face a higher probability of reverting, while farms with a higher income potential per labor unit, a higher degree of conversion, a higher share of vegetables, and a higher number of dairy or suckler cows are less likely to revert to conventional methods. Information on reversion behavior is needed when policy aims at reaching a higher share of organic area in a country. In order to prevent organic farmers from leaving the organic sector, we recommend offering an extended advisory service both before and during conversion as well as continuous support after conversion. Particular support for part-time farms or farms with pigs and poultry may contribute to the growth of the organic sector.",,,,10.30430/66.2017.1.13-25,2017-03-01,66,1,2017,,Articles,ART,,3,Sanna,Heinze,Alexander,Vogel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,667_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The EU-Argentinean Trade Dispute on Biodiesel: An Economic Assessment,en_US,"Argentina has a long record of taxing agricultural exports. In 2013, the European Commission started to impose antidumping duties on exports of Argentinean biodiesel. They were considered being dumped due to reduced export taxes compared to those applied to soybean oil exports. The objective of this paper is to analyze the economic consequences of these Argentinean differential taxes on the European biodiesel and related sectors. Thanks to an original model simulating the world markets of main arable crops, we first analyze the results of an increase of the export tax on biodiesel only. We then simulate the consequences of a reduction of export taxes on soybean products. Finally, we assess the impacts of the overall Argentinean policy of differentiated taxation of agricultural exports. One main conclusion is that European biodiesel producers are relatively more penalized than biodiesel producers in other countries by the current Argentinean policy, due to a relatively greater production of rapeseed. US and Brazilian producers suffer from welfare losses in all scenarios due to the indirect effects on soybean markets. The welfare impacts on consumers and taxpayers are often opposite to the welfare impacts on producers, leading to small global welfare effects.",,,,,2017-03-01,66,1,2017,,Articles,ART,,4,Alexandre,Gohin,Fabrice,Levert,Agneta,Forslund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,669_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,I Spy with my Little Eye: An Eye-tracking Study regarding the Perception and Evaluation of Pictures from Pig Fattening Barns,en_US,"In order to correct romantic ideas about livestock farming in society and to provoke acceptance of husbandry systems, there is a recent trend in the agricultural industry towards using real pictures of barns for communication purposes. Up to now there are only few studies investigating how these pictures are  perceived. The current study examines how these pictures from pig fattening barns are looked at and how they are evaluated by students (without and with connection to agriculture; in the following named as  citizens and farmers) to derive recommendations for the choice of pictures. Therefore, a survey is combined with eye-tracking. Pictures of a pen with fully slatted floor are evaluated negatively by citizens and different pictures of the same pen influence the evaluation. This is not the case for farmers who evaluate the pictures in a more neutral manner. However,  the eye movements of farmers and citizens when viewing the pictures are very similar in general. Independent of the picture, the face regions and bodies of  the animals are always viewed at first. Furthermore, we show that citizens do not recognize toys in a barn and unattractive or common pictures are viewed less. First recommendations for choosing pictures for  public relations in agriculture can be drawn from the results.",,,,,2017-06-01,66,2,2017,,Articles,ART,,2,Gesa,Busch,Sarah Arianna,Gauly,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,682_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Influence of Employer Awards on the Decision Making Process of Prospective Applicants in Medium-Sized Companies: An Empirical Analysis with Special Emphasis on the Food Industry,en_US,"In recent years, the evaluation of the organizational attractiveness by external parties has become an important tool to attract new personnel. This can be clearly observed by the rapid increase of employer awards as part of the external image of many companies. Whilst previous research has described the role of employer in general, this paper provides empirical data on the influence of employer awards on the decision-making process of prospective applicants within the food industry. This has been achieved by conducting a survey based on a choice experiment in which participants were confronted with different job advertisements. The results demonstrate that employer awards significantly influence applicants’ decisions, but their importance is lower compared to other company-specific criteria. This finding, however, remains significant only when the participants are not familiar with the employer award in question. The authors argue in favour of a critical, yet economically sensible usage of employer awards.",,,,,2017-09-01,66,3,2017,,Articles,ART,,1,Marina,Abramovskij,Ulrich,Enneking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,691_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Vertical Coordination in the Meat Supply Chain – The Effects of (Unlabeled) Private Standards for Animal Welfare,en_US,"Animal welfare is increasingly relevant in the public debate. As a reaction, German companies and associations in the farming, meat and retail sector intervened in the market for meat and founded an animal welfare initiative. Farmers are compensated for implemented animal welfare measures with money which is funded by retailers. The resulting meat is not labeled and thus not distinguishable from conventional meat. In our model, we show the relative merits of the initiative especially from a retailer’s point of view as compared to the introduction of labeled meat produced under restrictive practices. We combine our results with considerations on the distribution of market power and the degree of vertical coordination along the value chain for meat.",,,,,2017-09-01,66,3,2017,,Articles,ART,,2,Julia,Höhler,Rainer,Kühl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,689_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Sustainability Assessment of Agribusiness Clusters: A Case Study Based on Regional Sustainability Assessment Methodology,en_US,"Socioeconomic and environmental sustainability is becoming critical for the evaluation of regional development. Regional planning and policy development depend on accurate sustainability assessment for the estimation of genesis and evolution of agribusiness clusters. The lack of a universal methodology creates challenges for the analysis of regional issues and the role of separate industries in the sustainability of regional development. This research suggests and reviews the application of Regional Sustainability Assessment Methodology (RSAM) by using a case study approach with a special attention to agribusiness clusters. The empirical analyses reveal the importance of resource cycling in the regions, their dependency on external resources and self-sufficiency as indicators of regional sustainability (social, economic and environmental resource use efficiency) in a dynamic perspective, applicable to diverse regions and separate aspects of sustainability. The study areas include three sub-national level regions in Germany: two forming an agribusiness cluster, specialized in livestock-meat production (Vechta Landkreis and Cloppenburg Landkreis) and one control region (Hochsauerlandkreis). The application of RSAM revealed varying rates of resource use efficiency, self-sufficiency and dependency on external resources for both static and dynamic perspectives. The assessment indicated the potential of RSAM application for the static and dynamic assessment of regions with agribusiness clusters. At the same time, static analysis of separate aspects of sustainability (economic, social and environmental) was not informative. RSAM application to the separate types of resource analysis allowed identification of sustainability hotspots (unbalanced development, “weak sustainability” and increased dependency on separate resources).",,,,,2017-09-01,66,3,2017,,Articles,ART,,3,Sergiy,Smetana,Christine,Tamásy,Alexander,Mathys,Volker,Heinz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,690_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Estimating Location Values of Agricultural Land,en_US,"“Bodenrichtwerte” reflect the average location value of land plots within a specific area. They constitute an important source of information that contributes to price transparency on land markets. In Germany, “Bodenrichtwerte” are provided by publicly appointed expert groups (Gutachterausschüsse). Using empirical data from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania between 2013 and 2015, this article examines the relation between “Bodenrichtwerten” and statistically determined location values. It turns out that “Bodenrichtwerte” tend to underestimate location values of arable land by 11.5% on average. This underestimation can be traced back to the pronounced increase of land prices in the observation period. As an alternative to the expert-based determination of location values, we suggest a nonparametric smoothing procedure that rests on the Propagation-Separation Approach. The application of this data-driven procedure achieves an accuracy comparable to that of official “Bodenrichtwerte” at the one-year ahead prediction of location values without the requirement of expert knowledge.",,,,,2017-09-01,66,3,2017,,Articles,ART,,4,Georg,Helbing,Zhiwei,Shen,Martin,Odening,Matthias,Ritter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,692_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Dynamic Capabilities of Export Service Providers in the Fruit and Vegetable Sector: Approaches to Overcome Internal Export Barriers,en_US,"Intermediaries are the mainstay of fruit and vegetable commercialization in foreign markets. However, they face strategic problems that undermine their competitiveness and impede their international development. In order to compete in export markets, these mainly small and medium-sized enterprises require dynamic capabilities which are not possessed by all of them. Existing research has not fully researched dynamic capabilities which determine the success in the exportation of fresh fruit and vegetables. Based on seven in-depth interviews, our contribution in this work is to determine what specific dynamic capabilities of the fruit and vegetable distributing companies contribute to an improvement in the export performance. The results of the conducted explorative and qualitative study show that four dynamic capabilities, the relationship management, the consumer orientation, the transparency and the communication along the value chain and brand management can help to solve most of the internal barriers and strategies and as a consequence influence positively in the export results.",,,,,2017-12-01,66,4,2017,,Articles,ART,,1,Haydee Calderón,Garcia,Diana,Kolbe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,698_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Which Animal Welfare Measures should be implemented in Animal Welfare Programs? A Stakeholder Analysis,en_US,"In response to the growing number of citizens who express concerns about farm animal welfare in intensive, modern livestock farming, a number of programs that sell meat and other food products of animal origin from more animal friendly production systems (so called animal welfare programs) have emerged on the market in recent years. To successfully establish an animal welfare program in the market, the acceptance of several stakeholders along the supply chains of food products of animal origin is needed. For this reason, based on three quantitative empirical studies, this study investigates the perceived importance and practicability of 13 often discussed animal welfare measures from farmers’, veterinarians’ and consumers’ point of view. The results show that the evaluations of the animal welfare measures surveyed differ widely between the stakeholder groups. However, the results also give evidence that it is not impossible to develop an animal welfare program which meets the common concerns of consumers regarding animal welfare and at the same time is accepted by the experts directly involved in livestock production. For some animal welfare measures, there is still research demand to improve the practicability in conventional livestock farming. This is particularly urgent for the provision of outdoor access and the renouncement of curative interventions such as tail docking or teeth clipping as consumers rate these animal welfare measures as important for the wellbeing of animals while, at the same time, conventional farmers rate their practicability rather low. From the results, first implications for the conception of animal welfare programs can be derived. Thus, our study can help to establish a broader market segment for products from more animal friendly production system. In this way the more and more critical discourse between the broader public and the agricultural sector can be mitigated.",,,,,2017-12-01,66,4,2017,,Articles,ART,,2,Heinke,Heise,Ludwig,Theuvsen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,699_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,EU’s Regulation of Geographical Indications and their Effects on Trade Flows,en_US,"Nowadays one of the big issues in international trade is the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a bilateral trade agreement between the EU and USA. In these negotiations there are still many open questions, including dealing with the European protection of geographical indications (GIs). The objective of this paper is, therefore, to evaluate the impact of different GI products and protection levels in bilateral trade partnerships between the EU itself and third countries for the purpose of food policy recommendations in current negotiation processes. Based on panel data on agri-food trade of EU member countries with all trading partners for the period from 1996 to 2010, a gravity approach is used to estimate bilateral trade effects of GIs. The findings suggest that the protection of diverting products and levels for GIs have opposite effects on EUs trade partnerships. As results, considering EUs overall trade, GIs on wines and spirits only have a trade-creating effect if these are highly protected, while for other agricultural products only lower protection levels increase bilateral trade significantly.",,,,,2017-12-01,66,4,2017,,Articles,ART,,3,Daniel,Leufkens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,697_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Analysis of Stakeholders’ Expectations for Dairy Sector Development Strategies from a Central-Eastern and Western European Perspective,en_US,"The development paths chosen by farmers and the critical success factors involved can be better understood when the business context in which these farmers operate is known. Also, interaction in the chain contributes to the strength of the chain. This raises questions such as do chain parties cooperate and is there a certain consensus concerning the future strategic route? This article provides a unique analysis of how stakeholders envisage the future of dairy farming in a period of radical policy change and what barriers they foresee to their objectives. The questionnaire used examined perceptions on development strategies, availability of resources, opportunities &amp; threats (O&amp;T), farmer skills and future expectations. In 2015 and early 2016, a total of 161 completed questionnaires were collected from stakeholders (leading persons in the dairy chain) in the Netherlands, Slovenia, Lithuania and Poland. Data were analysed by PCA, ANOVA, cluster and stepwise regression methods. Eight strategic clusters of stakeholders were found. Farm expansion and specialisation was the most expected development strategy (57% of stakeholders). Almost one fourth of the stakeholders took a wait and see approach, of which 15% looked for opportunities to activate at a particular moment in time, while 8% were generally pessimistic about the future. Diversification in combination with organic farming was chosen by 5% of the stakeholders, 10% of stakeholders focused on cooperation, service and high tech, and another 5% placed their trust in skills, subsidies and labour. The opinions of stakeholders were highly affected by the country of origin, while only minor variations in opinions were observed between different categories of stakeholders. Polish stakeholders showed the most specialised view on the dairy chain, but they scored relatively low on cooperation. Development towards diversification and organic agriculture received higher scores in Slovenia and Lithuania compared to the Netherlands and especially to Poland. Netherlands’ stakeholders were the most positive about the future e.g. they foresee expansion and market opportunities. It was shown that strategies, resources and O&amp;T each directly affect future expectations, which was in agreement with the hypothetical model used.",,,,,2017-12-01,66,4,2017,,Articles,ART,,4,Abele,Kuipers,Agata,Malak-Rawlikowska,Aldona,Stalgiene,Marija,Klopčič,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,700_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,How does the Risk Attitude affect the Bidding Behavior of Farmers? Results of an Experimental Auction,en_US,"Auctioning off goods is a widespread practice in the agricultural sector. The revenue equivalence theorem predicts that independent of the type of auction, the revenues are identical under fulfillment of specific conditions. One of these conditions is that bidders must be risk neutral; this condition, however, often fails in reality. An experiment was carried out with farmers to investigate how the bid amount is influenced by the individual risk attitude. In the experiment, farmers were able to buy a good with a private value in four different auctions types. Results indicate that the revenues in auctions are affected by the risk attitude of the bidders. Moreover, the influence of the risk attitude depends on the auction type.",,,,,2018-02-28,67,1,2018,,Articles,ART,,1,Gesa Sophie,Holst,Oliver,Musshoff,Elisabeth,Vollmer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,706_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Explaining the Process for Conversion to Organic Dairy Farming in Sweden: An Alternative Modelling Approach,en_US,"To date, the process of conversion to organic farming has been analysed as a choice between only two alternatives, conventional versus organic farming. However, the conversion process in the EU is a two-tier decision, which brings the possibility of a nested structure between mixed and organic farming. In the context of Sweden, where the conversion investment is flexible, we attempted to identify economic determinants of the organic conversion process. For that purpose, we applied the nested Logit random utility maximisation (NLRUM) model to data from the Swedish farm accounting data network for 2002-2012. The analysis showed that milk prices, milk yield and environmental support payments play a significant role in the organic conversion process. As expected, a decrease in conventional milk prices would induce conventional farms to convert to organic production. The scale of conversion to organic farming was more pronounced among dairy farms located in regions with higher environmental support payments, and in regions endowed with more pasture land and leys.",,,,,2018-02-28,67,1,2018,,Articles,ART,,2,Shyam Kumar,Basnet,Gordana,Manevska-Tasevska,Yves,Surry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,707_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,There ain’t no such Thing as a Free Lunch: Intra-sustainable Trade-offs in Broiler Production from a Consumer’s Perception,en_US,"Expectations of the society regarding the production of food, especially the production of broiler meat, are continuously rising. From a production-related and environmental protection point of view, consumer demands cannot be implemented without conflicts. Trade-offs are induced in different dimensions, for example between animal welfare, climate protection and profitability. Little is known about consumer re-action to trade-offs in broiler production. With the help of ten 90-minute half structured guideline-based interviews, which were supported by images, it was investigated if consumers were aware of the trade-offs in broiler production systems. During these interviews, participants were shown pictures of both, floor systems with litter and free-range housing. Afterward they were given short, neutral texts with information to help illustrating the trade-offs. The results show that consumer awareness regarding trade-offs in broiler production systems hardly exists. Furthermore, reactions of citizens when confronted with trade-offs were analyzed. The decision process to solve the trade-offs problems was heterogeneous and dominated by animal welfare preferences. In general, participants´ decision behavior was different between the positively framed (outdoor access) and the negatively framed (floor system with litter) system. Participants´ consideration regarding the negative system (floor system with litter) was very emotional in most cases. Furthermore, cognitive dissonances and suppression could be observed. In contrast, the pros and cons of the positively framed system (outdoor access) were evaluated more rational, with goal dominance for animal welfare arguments.",,,,,2018-02-28,67,1,2018,,Articles,ART,,3,Winnie Isabel,Sonntag,Stefan,Golze,Achim,Spiller,Marie,von Meyer-Höfer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,708_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Can Global Climate Change affect Prices in the  World Banana Market?,en_US,"This paper explores the potential impacts of extreme weather events associated with climate change on prices in the international banana market. First, we made an inventory of the events reported to have affected banana export volumes for six exporter countries, as well as events reported to have affected banana import prices in the French market, between the years 2000 to 2015. We used weekly time-series to examine the impact of reported events on banana export volumes and on banana import prices. The first results indicate that weather events were the most frequently reported events to impact on export volumes and on consumer demand, thus confirming that they play a frequent role in determining prices. However, we also identified a wide range of other non-weather events which affect volumes, consumer demand and thus prices. We demonstrated that the extent to which extreme weather events affect prices is primarily determined by the coincidence of events and by the structural context of the exporting and importing countries. This study helps to put the potential impact of weather events related to climate change into perspective and highlights the ongoing role of market mechanisms, policy makers and stakeholders’ strategies in price variations in international commodity markets.",,,,,2018-02-28,67,1,2018,,Articles,ART,,5,Daniella,Blake,Carolina,Dawson,Denis,Leoillet,Charles,Staver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,713_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Future of Milk Delivery Relations from the Perspective of German Farmers,en_US,"In typical contractual relations between milk producers and processors in Germany, prices may currently function only to a limited extend as signals for quantity adjustments of milk production. This is one of the reasons why a reform of the contractual relationships has been frequently discussed. However, little is
known about the preferences of German milk producers regarding their preferred attributes of an ideal milk delivery relationship. Therefore, randomly selected farmers in different German regions where presented with Discrete-Choice-Experiments about different contractual attributes such as duration, pricing, cancellation period and quantity regulation. A random parameter logit model was estimated to identify drivers of preference heterogeneity. Results indicate that larger milk producers tend to favor fixed contractual solutions, while small and medium-sized producers tend to adhere to the currently prevailing cooperative delivery system of unregulated quantities of delivery and ex post pricing. However, the majority of milk producers want shorter cancellation periods with their dairy companies, and milk producers in East German federal states reject the typical cooperative delivery system more frequently than the respondents in West Germany.",,,,,2018-06-01,67,2,2018,,Articles,ART,,1,Julian,Petersen,Sebastian,Hess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,724_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Alley Cropping Agroforestry Systems: Using Monte-Carlo Simulation for a Risk Analysis in Comparison with Arable Farming Systems,en_US,"Alley cropping agroforestry systems are mixed farming systems in which forest stripes are cultivated simultaneously with annual crops or pasture systems. Agroforestry systems have several advantages like lower levels of soil erosion, the reduction of nutrient leaching, increasing biodiversity and an improvement of the landscape. Despite the various advantages, the number of agroforestry system in Germany is negligible and alley cropping is only applied at specific experimental sites. Reasons for this retention might be economic disadvantages in comparison with traditional annual cropping systems. In order to compare the profitability and risk profiles of agroforestry and traditional annual cropping systems, we applied Monte-Carlo simulation. The analysis is based on data from two different experimental farms in Germany. In comparison with an annual arable farming system, the experimental agroforestry system in Dornburg shows a higher expected value of the performance cost difference in combination with a lower standard deviation. For the second experimental site in Forst, the results also reveal a higher expected value of the performance cost difference for the agroforestry system in comparison to the annual arable farming system. However, differences to the first experimental area occur because in Forst the standard deviation is higher for the agroforestry system than for the annual arable farming system. Thus, in both cases the agroforestry system turns out to be more profitable than the annual arable farming system but in the case of the Forst the higher profitability goes hand in hand with higher risk. The results have manifold implications for agricultural policy and future research.",,,,,2018-06-01,67,2,2018,,Articles,ART,,2,Josef,Langenberg,Marius,Feldmann,Ludwig,Theuvsen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,725_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Effects of Green Nudges in Water Protection – An Experimental Investigation using a Business Management Game,en_US,"Nitrogen runoffs induced by agricultural fertilization cause serious environmental damage to surface waters. Environmental and consumer protectionists demand government intervention to mitigate these externalities. With this in mind, the present study examines the effects of nudge-based regulatory strategies. We use an incentivized multi-period single-player business management game as experimental device to study how nudges affect compliance with the minimum-distance-to-water rule in a sample of agricultural science students. We analyse two different nudge treatments: a nudge with pictures showing environmental and health damages that are presumably caused by breaching the minimum-distance-to-water rule, and a nudge with an additional social comparison, which suggests that the majority of farmers in the same region comply with the rule. We observe three core experimental outcomes: first, nudging has a preventive effect and reduces not only the share of non-compliant participants but also the total acreage that is irregularly fertilised. Second, against all expectations, the preventive effect of the nudge with pictures and a social comparison is weaker than that of the nudge with pictures alone. A further contra-intuitive result is that nudging increases the severity of infringements (in terms of the irregularly fertilised acreages) among the nonetheless remaining offenders; and this effect is even a bit stronger for the nudge with additional social comparison. Despite the overall limited generalizability of experimental findings based on student participants, the results show that nudging produced very different behavioural effects in different groups: It worked well as a preventive device in one subgroup, but within the rule-breaking group it increased the severity of offences. At present, we can only speculate about the drivers behind these contrary effects (e.g., reactance). However, the indication that the same policy measures might work in opposite directions in different subgroups provides an important subject of future research (policy impact analysis).",,,,,2018-06-01,67,2,2018,,Articles,ART,,3,Denise,Peth,Oliver,Mußhoff,Katja,Funke,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,726_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Economic Crisis and the Fragility of Comparative Advantage in European Agriculture,en_US,"The paper investigates the impact of the economic crisis on the duration of comparative advantage of agri-food products in European Union member states during the period 2000-2014 using normalised revealed comparative advantage indices. Specifically, we examine how the economic crisis affected comparative advantage indices at 1) the start of a period of comparative advantage, 2) during a period of comparative advantage, and 3) how quickly comparative advantage grew within a defined period. Duration and regression analyses are applied to examine the fragility of comparative advantage indices using alternative model specifications and estimation procedures. Estimations suggest that the comparative advantage for most agri-food products is short lived. Economic crisis reduces the duration and growth of comparative advantage, while spell duration, lag in comparative advantage and product differentiation reduce the probability of failure of duration of comparative advantage. Economic crisis and the duration of a period after-crisis reduce, and a period after-crisis and crisis-duration increase the growth of comparative advantage. These results are relevant for EU agri-food exporting countries, as the fragility of comparative advantage is found to be driven by both endogenous factors and the exogenous macro-economic-related shock of economic crisis. Exit from economic crisis and product differentiation have strengthened the comparative advantage of EU-28 member states in terms of differentiated agri-food product varieties for final consumption.",,,,,2018-09-01,67,3,2018,,Articles,ART,,1,Štefan,Bojnec,Imre,Fertő,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,729_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,A Foresight Study of European East-West Agrifood Trade Options,en_US,"Taking a trade perspective with a focus on agrifood markets, the current foresight study employs a computable general equilibrium simulation model to quantify the implications of different future pathways of European East-West trade relations for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), thereby providing insight on how best to orientate their political and trade strategies. Comparing with a baseline, two optimistic pathways explore greater market access, both within Europe (‘Deep integration’) and globally (‘trade liberalisation’). In contrast, an isolationist ‘trade bloc’ pathway reflecting a deteriorating political situation between Russia and the West is also examined.
In the ‘baseline’, Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) members realise market gains, whilst intra-CIS trade diversion effects are small. The ‘deep integration’ scenario (‘liberalisation’ scenario) generates significant relative benefits for DCFTA signatories’ agrifood (non-agrifood) activities. In both of these trade reform narratives, the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU) economic gains are biased in favour of Russia’s energy sector resulting in greater import dependence on agrifood commodities from the EU. The isolationist trade narrative nurtures EAEU agrifood activity, although at the cost of its macroeconomic growth.",,,,,2018-09-01,67,3,2018,,Articles,ART,,2,George,Philippidis,Ana,Sanjuán,Andrzej,Tabeau,Siemen,van Berkum,Monika,Verma,,,,,,,,,,,,,730_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Wine Farms between Specialisation and Diversification – Empirical Insights from Switzerland and Romania,en_US,"While economists often emphasise the advantages of specialisation, power asymmetries between farmers and processors and risk mitigation are arguments for diversification in the primary sector. Swiss and Romanian wine farms are used to test the hypothesis that pressing grapes and processing them into wine will be financially advantageous for wine farms, while other diversification strategies are less promising. Survey results verify this hypothesis for Switzerland. For Romania, a winery on the farm and a positive attitude towards wine tourism are advantageous. Some amenities on the farm such as events or playgrounds allow higher prices to be charged, but this does not result in a better financial situation. Another success factor for both countries is the combination with arable farming. The conclusion is that targeted and well-adapted diversification strategies on wine farms can be recommended.",,,,,2018-09-01,67,3,2018,,Articles,ART,,3,Stefan,Mann,Petrica,Stefan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,731_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Farms Employing Foreign Workers in Italy: An Analysis with Census Micro Data,en_US,"Over the last decades, foreign workers have become a significant component of Italian agriculture workforce. Their presence and incidence are highly diversified with respect to farm typologies, type of contract and geographic location. A comprehensive representation of this complex phenomenon is thus the first step to understand the different problems and needs associated to the employment of foreign workforce. This study uses micro data from the 2010 Italian Agricultural Census to first describe what are the structural and geographical features of Italian farms employing foreign workers and then to group farms through a cluster analysis. Results give a detailed representation of the incidence of foreign workers employed, revealing which part of Italian agriculture relies more on foreign workers. The cluster analysis allows the definition of six groups: foreign workers are especially involved in livestock activities, both indoor and grazing and in farms specialized in permanent crops. Among major policy implications, analysing the presence of foreign workers can help targeting policies to agricultural production system needs.",,,,,2018-09-01,67,3,2018,,Articles,ART,,4,Silvia,Coderoni,Concetta,Cardillo,Maria Carmela,Macrì,Maria Angela,Perito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,737_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,"A Public Perspective of Undercover Investigations in Animal Husbandry – an Interaction between Agriculture, Animal Welfare Organizations and Governmental Control",en_US,"Undercover investigations in animal husbandry have attracted great media attention in recent years. Animal welfare organizations, farmers and politi-cians have been discussing the need for undercover investigations and their consequences for animal activists. Since the public perspective and its influencing factors had not previously been scientifically investigated an exploratory study with 292 German consumers is conducted. Using structural equation modeling the attitude to undercover investigations and their influencing factors are revealed. Generally the results show a positive attitude towards undercover investigations. They are perceived as necessary for animal welfare reasons because state-owned control mechanisms are unsatisfactory. In addition, the results show that the work of responsible animal welfare organizations receives social approval and the public is unsure about the psychological burden on affected farmers. The positive attitude towards undercover investigations is influenced by the increasingly critical view on livestock farming. However, the public rejects harsher punishment of investigators. Undercover investigations demonstrate the discrepancy between agriculture and society and show that the welfare of farm animals is becoming increasingly important.",,,,,2018-12-01,67,4,2018,,Articles,ART,,1,Maureen,Schulze,Antje,Risius,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,749_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Citizens’ Perception of Recent Livestock Production Systems in Germany,en_US,"In this study, we examine citizens’ perceptions of recent livestock production in Germany. Thereby, we focus against the backdrop of seven animal species-specific guidelines written by Scientific Advisory Board on Agricultural Policy, Food and Consumer Health Protection at the Federal Minis-try (WBA, 2015). We combine a qualitative study with focus group discussions about pig, cattle and poultry production systems and a quantitative online survey with factor analysis. Based upon the findings of the exploratory factor analysis, a clus-ter analysis was conducted to assign respondents to groups. The results provide an overview of citi-zens’ recent perceptions and attitudes, show differ-ences and commonalities with regard to the three main livestock production systems pig, cattle and poultry production.

,Consumer Acceptance of Dual-Purpose Chickens - A Mixed Methods Approach,en_US,"The killing of day-old male chicks of laying breeds is common practice and is widely discussed within society. There are few alternatives available to replace this practice. One possibility is the use of dual-purpose chicken breeds. The use of these chicken breeds would have implications not only for the entire supply food chain but also for con-sumers. Their meat and eggs have a different ap-pearance, and the resulting products would be more expensive. Furthermore, little is known about consumers’ opinions of dual-purpose chickens at present. For this reason, it is essential to explore consumer acceptance of dual-purpose chickens. Mixed methods with a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods proved to be an appro-priate approach to learn more about this matter. The results of six focus groups with an explo-ratory character served as the basis for an online survey with 1,502 respondents in Germany. The data was analysed with the aid of a factor analysis that identified seven factors explaining consumers’ attitudes towards dual-purpose chickens. A cluster analysis segmented the respondents into three cluster groups: opponents (37.5%), supporters (23.4%), and indifferents (39.1%). The indifferents represent the largest group of respondents and are therefore an important target group when it comes to potential marketing strategies of products from dual-purpose chickens. The results illustrate the importance of analysing consumer acceptance with regard to emerging issues and before a new product is introduced to the market.",,,,,2018-12-01,67,4,2018,,Articles,ART,,3,Nanke,Brümmer,Wiebke,Petersen,Inken,Christoph-Schulz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,738_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Perception and Evaluation of a Pig Fattening Pen Based on Film Material in an Online Survey Experiment with German Citizens,en_US,"As many parts of today’s society have only few direct connections to farming, an increasing alienation of the population from agriculture is noticed in Germany. Especially pig farming is criticised due to a discrepancy between farmers’ and citizens’ perception of animal welfare in modern livestock farming. With regard to the increasing use of the internet, social media, picture and film materials have become essential in communication about livestock production. In this context, it is important to deal with the effects of pictures and videos on citizens’ perception and evaluation. In general, the perception of videos is affected by the viewers’ characteristics. Apart from that, the perception of videos is affected by picture design and picture elements. The aim of the present study is to analyse people’s perceptions and evaluations of film material showing a pig fattening pen. For this purpose, 464 participants were randomly shown four out of sixteen videos in an online experiment. The videos varied according to housing conditions (e.g. weight of the pigs, stocking density) and recording conditions (e.g. camera angle, lighting conditions). A cluster analysis based on belief in animal mind, interest and knowledge about pig farming and meat consumption was conducted. Subsequently, the identified segments, the different housing con-ditions and the recording conditions of the videos were used as independent variables to perform an analysis of variance with the evaluations of the videos as dependent variable.
The results show that the identified clusters significantly differ in the evaluations of the videos. Furthermore, housing conditions have a higher impact than recording conditions. The results indicate that high stocking densities lead to negative evaluations. It can be assumed that respondents do not recognise minor differences in film material. In general the videos were rated poorly. This implies for PR that improving recording conditions of the videos might not lead to a better evaluation of livestock farming than improving housing conditions. Different information requirements in different clusters should be considered in agricultural PR.",,,,,2018-12-01,67,4,2018,,Articles,ART,,4,Anna,Wernsmann,Christiane,Wildraut,Marie,von Meyer-Höfer,Marcus,Mergenthaler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,739_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,An Empirical Study of Internet Use Intensity in German Agriculture,en_US,"The internet plays a promising role for the future development of rural areas and offers several potential business relevant applications for agricultural entrepreneurs. Yet, little is known about the determinants of internet use intensity of German farmers. Thus, this paper empirically explores factors affecting internet use intensity in German agriculture using a representative data set collected in 2016. The representative data were analyzed using an ordered probit model. The results indicate that age, education, farm size and farm location play a statistical significant role. Moreover, our results show that farmers, who feel informed about dangers of the web, are more likely to be frequent internet user. Our results can be of interest for both policy makers and providers since they offer first insights into the determinants of German farmers’ internet use intensity and, thus, provide hints for potential improvements in this area.",,,,,2019-03-01,68,1,2019,,Articles,ART,,1,Marius,Michels,Wilm,Fecke,Jan-Henning,Feil,Oliver,Mußhoff,Johanna,Pigisch,Saskia,Krone,,,,,,,,,,,750_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Measurement of Time-Varying Technical Efficiency and Productivity Change in Polish Crop Farms,en_US,"The main aim of this study is to measure the technical efficiency and decompose total factor productivity (TFP) growth of Polish crop farms. The novelty of our contribution is threefold. First of all, our work contributes to research on agricultural performance of Central and Eastern European countries in the post-European Union accession period. Secondly, compared to previous studies, our study expands them by decomposition of total factor productivity growth for a specific sector based on a very extensive dataset, thus providing a more in-depth analysis of factors driving productivity growth. Thirdly, we have thoroughly explored the same data set by several different models, showing consequences of choosing a particular model. The empirical analysis is based on a balanced panel of farms, from 2004 to 2011, taken from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Findings show that the average technical efficiency was only 63%. The elasticity of production was highest with respect to materials and lowest with respect to area. The capital elasticity was statistically non-significant. We point out that this sector is characterized by increasing returns to scale, with estimates ranging from 1.05 to 1.3 for the majority of observations. Furthermore, the results show that TFP was slightly decreasing (on average by 0.067% per annum) over the entire period.",,,,,2019-03-01,68,1,2019,,Articles,ART,,2,Jerzy,Marzec,Andrzej,Pisulewski,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,751_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Agricultural Professionalization of Austrian Family Farm Households – the Effects of Vocational Attitude, Social Capital and Perception of Farm Situation",en_US,"Household strategies of farming families refer to the medium to long-term orientation of the farm operation. They also constitute the goal and the framework for entrepreneurial behavior and reflect the living concept of the farming family as well as the operative processes of adapting the farm to a changing environment. In this study we explore on the household strategy agricultural professionalization of farmers according to their vocational attitudes, their social capital and their assessments of farming and family resources. A binary logistic regression was applied to data from a survey of 388 farmers in the Austrian district of St. Poelten. The final explanatory model demonstrates that a high level of social capital in family and community in combination with a positive assessment of the survivability of a farm and a positive attitude towards one’s vocation render it very likely that plans are made for agricultural professionalization.",,,,,2019-03-01,68,1,2019,,Articles,ART,,3,Manuela,Larcher,Reinhard,Engelhart,Stefan,Vogel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,752_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Determinants of Capital Structure: Evidence from Polish Food Manufacturing Industry,en_US,"The aim of this paper is to identify factors influenc-ing the capital structure of Polish food manufacturing companies. In the first part of the paper, the most probable determinants of the capital structure have been identified on the basis of literature review and the current research conducted in this field. The second part of the paper presents an empirical verification of the relationship between capital structure and its fundamental determinants. The study was made using panel models. The scope of the survey covered Polish food companies between 2012 and 2015. Key determinants of total debt in the food manufacturing companies include: share of fixed assets in total assets, liquidity, profitability and non-debt tax shield with negative relationship. These factors also include: business size and growth with a positive relationship. For the long-term debt, the following factors are important: share of fixed assets in total assets, size of the business and liquidity (positive relationship). A negative relationship has been diagnosed for profitability and non-debt tax shield. The identified factors and the direction of dependence are similar to those previously diagnosed in the Czech Republic and Italy. However, they differ significantly from those of the US and Turkey. The capital structure of Polish food enterprises, measured by the total debt ratio, is best explained by the pecking order theory, while the share of long-term debt in the capital structure can be explained by static trade-off theory.",,,,,2019-03-01,68,1,2019,,Articles,ART,,4,Jacek,Jaworski,Leszek,Czerwonka,Magdalena,Mądra-Sawicka,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,753_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Impact of Size on Exiting from Livestock Production - an Empirical Analysis of Dairy and Sow Farms in Germany,en_US,"We study the exit from livestock production of 35,000 German farms. By means of regression analysis we identify the factors affecting farmers' decisions either to quit farming altogether or to abandon certain livestock enterprises (sows and dairy cows). For our data, results from binomial probit estimations are either valid for quitting farming altogether or exiting from livestock production only. The determinants for these two decisions are different. Consequently, for analyzing the decision to exit from livestock production a multinomial probit model is preferred over a binomial model since a livestock farmer has three options to choose from: continuing livestock production, exiting from farming, or exiting from livestock production while keeping arable farming. For both dairy farms and sow farms we find that larger herd sizes make the abandonment of the respective livestock enterprises less likely. By contrast, the decision to quit farming altogether is not affected by herd size. We thus find no evidence in support of the much cited conjecture that the size of a farm's livestock enterprise increases the probability of its survival.",,,,,2019-09-01,68,3,2019,,Articles,ART,,1,Insa,Thiermann,Gunnar,Breustedt,Carolin,Rosenau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,774_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Typology of Forward-Looking Direct Marketing Farms – an Empirical Analysis in Germany,en_US,"Direct marketing of food may enable farmers to generate higher incomes. Originally, direct marketing comprised on farm sales and weekly markets, but it has recently developed into a professionalized marketing approach of various forms. Hereby, the direct marketers differ by marketing channel, the range of products or the number of labour used. Although direct marketing is an important source of income for some farms, only a few studies have addressed a detailed description of direct marketers so far. This research gap is tackled with by an empirical study of 39 direct marketers. A cluster analysis identified 4 types of direct marketers. Some direct marketers try to offer a full range of products, similar to a retail strategy. Others are specialized in selling to specific actors in the value chain, e.g. the retail. Also the results confirm the classic on farm shop to sell mainly its own produce. The typology may provide a useful guidance for direct marketers or regular farmers when structuring their future farm business.",,,,N.A.,2019-09-01,68,3,2019,,Articles,ART,,2,Stefan-Clemens,Wille,Marie,von Meyer-Höfer,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,775_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Role of Cooperations in Water Protection from the Water Suppliers’ Perspective,en_US,"With their cooperations in Germany, farmers and water supply companies have a special role in securing the drinking water supply and in reducing the nitrate content. Farmers contribute to environmental protection by reducing the amount of fertiliser used, but despite the fact that less mineral fertiliser is used, they have no financial disadvantage due to the compensation payments. Water supply companies thus have less expenses for water treatment and can use these financial savings for compensation payments. Changing political framework conditions such as the amendment of the Fertiliser Ordinance and the Nitrate Report 2016, published in January 2017, gave rise to the investigation of such cooperations between farmers and water supply companies. This study focuses on the challenges and success factors of cooperations from the point of view of the water supply companies. For this purpose, a qualitative empirical study was carried out with experts from the water industry. The interview partners were selected according to the snowball sampling and convenience sampling. The data collection took place in the form of guided expert interviews. The data evaluation was performed on the basis of the qualitative content analysis according to Mayring with category formation. As a result, it can be summarised that the political framework conditions and their changes have a major influence on cooperations in water management. Due to the voluntary nature of cooperations, not all farmers working in water protection areas are involved in a cooperation. Successful communication among all participants is both a framework condition and a success factor, without which cooperations cannot function in the long term. The heterogeneous organisational forms of coopera­tions at the national level can be regarded as advantages and disadvantages in that, on the one hand, site specifics can be taken into account in the design of cooperations and, on the other hand, a guideline for general cooperation standards and financing is lacking.",,,,,2019-09-01,68,3,2019,,Articles,ART,,3,Katja,Beck,Andrea,Knierim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,776_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Implicit Prices of Sustainability on the German Online Market for Honey,en_US,"Sustainability characteristics play an increasing role in food markets. At least some consumers are willing to pay a price for organic or regional production, animal welfare or fairtrade. In order to analyse implicit prices of sustainability characteristics, it is important to go beyond consumer studies as such characteristics affect marginal costs as well. We employ a hedonic price analysis to compare the price premium of very different sustainability characteristics on the German online market for honey. Honey is particularly interesting, because it is perceived as a natural product, and regional and organic production competes with, for example, fairtrade products from developing countries. Consumer prices for honey contain positive as well as negative implicit prices for sustainability characteristics. Apparently, consumer valuation in terms of the marginal willingness to pay and marginal costs differ strongly across the sustainability",,,,,2019-09-01,68,3,2019,,Articles,ART,,4,Katharina,Bissinger,Roland,Herrmann,Lisa,Krandick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,782_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

The severity of the Greek crisis, which affected the main determinants of IIT, presents a unique opportunity to study producers’ reaction and infer on policy targets to assist trade during economic downturns. I concentrate on agricultural and food products, as they have received less attention in the IIT literature and examine IIT through the Grubel-Lloyd index and by separating IIT into Horizontal IIT (HIIT), and high and low-quality Vertical IIT (HVIIT and LVIIT). Results indicate the post-2009 growth of high-quality VIIT exports in products that require a high degree of processing.

,What Does the Agricultural Sector really Think about Crop Protection? Results of an Implicit Association Test,en_US,"Chemical plant protection and protection by genetic modification of crops are being discussed controversially by the public as well as by the agri-food industry itself. However, attitudes towards different methods of plant protection have so far only been studied by standard surveys, which may provide a biased or incomplete picture. This study contributes information about the perception of different methods of plant protection by examining explicit as well as implicit attitudes of agricultural students — the future producers and decision-makers of the agricultural sector. The implicit attitudes were measured using a Single-Category Implicit Association Test. The test was conducted with 233 agricultural students. The results show that agricultural students assess chemical crop protection and protection by genetic modification of crops positively in a direct survey, but show negative attitudes in the case of implicit measurement. This indicates that opinions in the controversial crop protection debate, thus far solely assessed based on surveys, should be critically reviewed.",,,,,2019-12-01,68,4,2019,,Articles,ART,,1,Ulf,Römer,Henning,Schaak,Oliver,Mußhoff,Heinrich S.,Goudschaal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,799_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,(Dis-)Satisfaction in Agriculture? An Explorative Analysis of Job and Life Satisfaction in East Germany,en_US,"Attractive working and living conditions are crucial in the competition for skilled workers. While the overall number of studies that investigate job and life satisfaction has increased substantially over the last few years, detailed regional and branch specific descriptions of the job and life satisfaction of agricultural workers are lacking. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 2000 to 2015, we explore the job and life satisfaction of the agricultural workforce in crop production in East Germany in comparison to other sectors of the economy. The main findings of this study are: (i) the job satisfaction of agricultural workers (crop production) is considerably higher than their life satisfaction, whereas in other sectors job and life satisfaction levels are very similar. (ii) Compared to other sectors of the economy, agricultural workers (crop production) report higher levels of job satisfaction. (iii) Similarly, job satisfaction among unskilled agricultural workers exceeds the job satisfaction of unskilled workers in other sectors of the economy. These results do not indicate that poor working conditions in agriculture are the main reason for the shortage of (skilled) labor in the agricultural sector.",,,,,2019-12-01,68,4,2019,,Articles,ART,,2,Antje,Jantsch,Tobias,Weirowski,Norbert,Hirschauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,800_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,German Bioeconomy: Economic Importance and Concept of Measurement,en_US,"In recent literature concept and implications of bio¬economy are being discussed extensively and in many cases the term bioeconomy rather serves as a framework for discussion than as an operational basis for estimating size and economic importance. Nevertheless, several of such estimates exist on national and European level. Due to the application of different and sometimes not comprehensible methodology, these estimates cannot be properly compared and evaluated. Therefore, the objective of this article is the development of a transparent method for estimating the economic importance of bioeconomy and the application of this method to provide a comprehensive estimate of the German bioeconomy. Our analysis bases on various official statistics and refers to the year 2014. The size of the bioeconomy is described by the indicators employment, gross value added and turnover. We estimate bioeconomy related employment to range between 3.7-4 million jobs, bio-based gross added value to reach 116-135 bill. EUR and bio-based turnover to range between 451-520 bill. EUR. Challenges in estimating economic importance are data availability and the fact that existing classifications of economic activities do not allow distinguishing fossil-based and bio-based economic activities.",,,,,2019-12-01,68,4,2019,,Articles,ART,,3,Susanne,Iost,Naemi,Labonte,Martin,Banse,Natalia,Geng,Dominik,Jochem,Jörg,Schweinle,Sascha,Weber,Holger,Weimar,,,,,,,801_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,"Marketing Potential for Biocyclic-Vegan Products? A Qualitative, Explorative Study with Experts and Consumers",en_US,"The number of consumers who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet and people who purchase organic food is increasing worldwide. The labelling of food products with a vegan label only refers to the ingredients, not to the production method. Therefore, animal products e.g. slurry, meal pellets and animal by-products can be used in the chain of agricultural production. A new biocyclic-vegan label, which refers to an exclusion of any animal by-product during production, was introduced in Germany in 2017. The product life cycle consists of five stages. The production method of biocyclic-vegan agricultural products is a new approach. Therefore, very little is known about consumer awareness of these products. As a result, this study is of an exploratory nature and investigates which needs biocyclic-vegan products can satisfy and which additional values these products offer in comparison to organic products. As little is known about the biocyclic-vegan production method, telephone interviews involving six experts and six vegetarian/vegan consumers from Germany were carried out. The interviews took place in January 2018. The consumer convenience sample was selected based on age, gender and profession while the experts were selected based on their expertise. On average the interviews lasted 20 minutes. The interviews consisted of 20 questions. Both, consumers and experts were included to gain knowledge from each perspective. The three key results are that most interviewees knew about biocyclic-vegan production and were able to explain the meaning. Another major result is that consumers mention that the purchase reason is to support the idea of biocyclic-vegan agriculture while experts name ethical reasons as a main purchase reason. The third key result is that the barriers of purchasing the products are the price, lack of knowledge and credibility. As this is an explorative study, further research is needed e.g. more in-depth interviews consisting of a larger sample size and a more diverse sample including consumers following different diets such as flexitarians. Moreover quantitative approaches would give valuable insights into the topic.",,,,,2019-12-01,68,4,2019,,Articles,ART,,4,Kristin,Jürkenbeck,Lara,Schleicher,Stephan G.H.,Meyerding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,802_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Animal-Ethical Intuitions in Germany: Developing a Measuring Instrument to Capture Domain-Specific Values in the Context of the Human-Animal Relationship,en_US,"In the recent past, society has increasingly questioned the way animals are treated, especially so-called farm animals. Such ethical values, dealing with the morally correct treatment of animals, affect human behaviour. Therefore, it is of great importance for the agricultural sector in particular to gain a deeper understanding of animal-ethical values in society in order to meet the changing demands. Since such animal-ethical values cover the thematic complex of the human-animal relationship in a very general way and mirror fundamental values, they can be classified in the human value system at the level of domain-specific values. Domain-specific values are characterized by the fact that they are relatively stable over time and are to a certain extent generalizable. The aim of the present study is to develop reliable and valid scales to capture domain-specific values in the context of the human-animal relationship. This is based on core statements of central animal-ethical positions from philosophy. A confirmatory factor analysis reveals that animal-ethical values can be identified in society and that the developed scales are of good reliability and validity. Furthermore, the descriptive results provide a first overview of which animal-ethical values are represented in the German population. Thus, the original anthropocentrism, allowing humans to treat animals as they want, is almost completely rejected. The new contractarian approach (“New Deal”), however, receives an extremely high level of approval. This animal-ethical position in principle allows humans to use animals, but, in exchange, they have to enable them to live a good life.",,,,,2019-12-01,68,4,2019,,Articles,ART,,5,Sarah,Hölker,Holmer,Steinfath,Marie,von Meyer-Höfer,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,809_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Agricultural Economics Research and the Global Sustainable Development Goals,en_US,"This paper discusses the relevance of agricultural economics research in the context of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. During the last few decades, agricultural economics has made important contributions to hunger and poverty reduction and rural development. Many of the traditional topics of agricultural economics remain important, but several new topics and research questions have also emerged more recently. New topics involve the manifold interactions between agriculture, nutrition, health, the environment, climate change, and societal attitudes. Analysis of these interactions increasingly requires interdisciplinary and systemic approaches. In principle, the agricultural economics profession is well equipped to address such new interdisciplinary topics, but it could do so more confidently and visibly, in order to remain relevant for the big policy topics also in the future.",,,,,2019-12-01,68,Supplement 2,2019,,Articles supplement,ASup,,2,Matin,Qaim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,793_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Teaching Agricultural Economics – Scientific Claims and Demands of Society,en_US,"Teaching agricultural economics widely reflects new research developments providing analytical competence. However, does teaching also give orientation on current and relevant demands of society, encouraging and sharpening the assessment capacity of students on such questions? There are doubts. In this paper we sketch out some deficits and address some possible reasons. A basic problem is a widespread critical view on economic thinking in public debates that does not stop at the lecture hall. Though, there are home-made problems, too. We suggest a stronger focus on the normative economic toolbox and its use for demands of society.

,What Moves the German Land Market? A Decomposition of the Land Rent-Price Ratio,en_US,"The price increases on agricultural land markets over the last decade have triggered a debate about land as an attractive investment opportunity for agricultural and non-agricultural investors. In a static environment, the rent-price ratio provides a first indicator of the profitability of an investment in land. In this paper, we apply the dynamic Gordon growth model to Western Germany and decompose the rent-price ratio into the expected present values of rental growth rates, real interest rates, and a land premium, i.e., the excess return on investment. This analysis reveals that the recent price surge on agricultural land markets was not unprecedented; that the land market rent-price ratio is rather low and varies considerably among federal states; and that (expected) premia for land are mostly negative. Finally, we find that changing expected present values of returns on land investments are the major driver for land price volatility.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.1.1-18,2020-02-28,69,1,2020,,Articles,ART,,2,Jana,Plogmann,Oliver,Mußhoff,Martin,Odening,Matthias,Ritter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,810_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Optimal Wheat Futures Hedge at the Euronext Paris from a Farmer’s Perspective,en_US,"Futures contracts are extensively used by commercial market participants to hedge commodities against the risk of adverse price fluctuations. But although farmers have faced increased volatility in commodity prices in recent years, only very few of them actively use hedging as a risk management instrument. In this article we analyze the hedging potential of the Euronext milling wheat futures market for German farmers based on the estimation of optimal static as well as optimal dynamic hedge ratios. We find that both hedging approximately one year and half a year before harvesting leads to a reduction in the variance of returns compared with unhedged portfolios. But this risk minimization is achieved at the cost of lower returns on average. In addition we find that margin calls might be one of the reasons why so few farmers hedge since they cause liquidity problems especially in marketing years with unanticipated price shocks.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.1.49-63,2020-02-28,69,1,2020,,Articles,ART,,4,Teresa,Vollmer,Stephan,von Cramon-Taubadel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,813_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Biased Survey Results as Basis of Political Decision-Making – An Analysis using the Example of Farm Animal Welfare,en_US,"Survey results may be biased systematically due to a variety of effects. Concomitantly they are often of high relevance for political decision making. This is no problem, as long as effective bias-prevention-methods are applied during the conduction and interpretation of surveys. Regarding social desirability this is usually not the case. Political decisions, based on biased survey results, lead to misallocation. Taking the example of farm animal welfare and using different social desirability scales, the present paper shows, that the citizen-consumer-gap stems from socially desirable response behavior in previous consumer surveys. Therefore, their results should not be taken implicitly as a basis for political or business investment decisions. In addition, further causes of the citizen-consumer-gap concerning farm animal welfare are analyzed.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.1.64-79,2020-02-28,69,1,2020,,Articles,ART,,5,Anne,Piper,Rainer,Kühl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,814_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Income Risk of German Farms and its Drivers,en_US,"The analysis of income risk is the basis for successful whole farm risk management. The measurement of risks helps to objectively assess the farms’ individual risk exposure. However, due to limited data availability, comprehensive overall risk analyses are often scarce, e.g. for Germany. The present study analyses risk exposure for more than 3,000 farms in Germany in the period 1996/97-2015/16 on the basis of the national Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Our results show that (i) risk exposure is heterogeneous and that fluctuations and particularly large decreases in farm income are rarely attributable to individual risk components (e. g. prices or yields), (ii) farm income risk has been higher in the period after 2007 for many farms, especially arable and dairy farms, (iii) while the income risk in dairy farming increased, it is still lower than that of most other farm types in the period 2006/07-2015/16, (iv) the for-mation of expected values has a significant influence on the absolute level of the measured risk and should be given more attention in future research.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.2.85-107,2020-05-28,69,2,2020,,Articles,ART,,1,Christoph,Duden,Frank,Offermann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,824_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Farm Level Impacts of Trade Liberalisation and CAP Removal Across EU: An Assessment using the IFM-CAP Model,en_US,"This paper assesses the farm-level impacts of trade liberalisation and CAP removal across EU using IFM-CAP (Individual Farm Model for CAP Analysis). IFM-CAP is a static positive programming model developed to capture the full heterogeneity of EU farms in terms of feedback to policy representation and impacts. Simulation results show that a small set of farm-types experience an increase in income due to the improvement in prices and yields (e.g. farms specialised in granivores, milk and horticulture), while farms that are most CAP subsidy dependent (e.g. specialist cattle, specialist COP and small farms) lose income by more than 12% at aggregate EU level. As much as 77% of all farms lose income if CAP is removed, while the proportion of most income vulnerable farms almost doubles.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.2.108-126,2020-05-28,69,2,2020,,Articles,ART,,2,Pavel,Ciaian,Maria,Espinosa,Kamel,Louhichi,Angel,Perni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,825_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,An Empirical Study of Smartphone Use Intensity in German Agriculture,en_US,"Smartphone apps and the inbuilt-sensors can be seen as a subarea of precision farming technologies. Furthermore, an increase in smartphone-based decision support tools is observed in the last years. While the adoption of smartphones and willingness to pay for apps by farmers were already investigated, little is known about the use intensity of smartphones in agriculture. Against this background, 272 German farmers were asked how many agriculture-themed apps they are using. A negative binomial regression is applied to analyze the determinants of the smartphone use intensity measured in the number of used apps. Besides other factors, our results show that the use intensity is statistically significantly affected by farmers’ age and education. No statistically significant effect is found for satisfaction with mobile internet coverage. Our results are of interest for developers and providers of apps as well as policy makers as they provide first essential information about the use intensity of smartphone-based decision support tools in agriculture. Aspects of data security should be recognized in the development of public training programs in terms of digitalization. Moreover, the interface of an app and the presentation of information through the app should be kept simple to be useful for all farmers.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.2.127-142,2020-05-28,69,2,2020,,Articles,ART,,3,Marius,Michels,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,826_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Can Food Waste Reduction in Europe Help to Increase Food Availability and Reduce Pressure on Natural Resources Globally?,en_US,"In recent years, reducing food waste and loss has become a policy priority in the European Union, but little is known about impacts of related measures in the EU and beyond. This study informs the debate on food waste reduction through a quantitative analysis. It considers adjustment costs for reducing food waste in food processing industries and impacts on food availability, pressure on land and water and other environmental consequences. The results suggest that the leakage effects of global trade may offset almost all benefits of food waste reduction in the EU. We thus conclude that costly efforts to reduce food waste in the EU cannot be motivated by larger contributions to global food availability and environmental benefits. This highlights the need for global coordination of such policies and/or more targeted actions in the EU which focus on specific production chains, where losses can be reduced and environmental gains obtained at a relatively low cost.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.2.143-168,2020-05-28,69,2,2020,,Articles,ART,,4,Yaghoob,Jafari,Wolfgang,Britz,Hasan,Dudu,Roberto,Roson,Martina,Sartori,,,,,,,,,,,,,827_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Citizens’ Attitudes towards Greening as Part of Common Agricultural Policy: Results of a Panel Survey,en_US,"Modern agriculture is increasingly in the focus of the critical public regarding its too low environmental sustainability. The so-called Greening was introduced as an additional policy tool into the current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for providing incentives for more environmental protection. The Greening is expected to contribute to the implementation of a more environmental and climate friendly land management. To socially and politically justify support programmes for environmental protection, it is important to identify citizens’ attitudes towards such programmes. So far, only studies regarding citizens’ attitudes towards the GAP in general exist but no studies regarding environmental measures such as pillar 2 measures or Greening exist. To close this research gap, this paper seeks to analyse German citizens’ attitudes towards the Greening with the help of a cluster analysis. Our analysis of a panel-data set with 499 participants shows that citizens support the Greening in total. However, attitudes diverge regarding remuneration of environmental benefits as well as tightening Greening requirements.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.3.173-182,2020-08-31,69,3,2020,,Articles,ART,,1,Lara,Beer,Heinke,Heise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,829_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Randomised Controlled Trials for the Evaluation of the CAP: Em-pirical Evidence about Acceptance by Farmers,en_US,"To conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the Common Agricultural Policy it would be necessary to exclude a random selection of farms from participation. This exclusion might limit the acceptance of RCTs. We assess the acceptance of an innovative alternative RCT called the ‘unconditional payment RCT’ (upRCT). UpRCTs allow for the evaluation of the impact of policy measures in which farmers receive a payment conditional on the adoption of farm management practices (e.g., agri-environment-climate measures). We surveyed Austrian farmers who participated in the ‘refrain from silage’ measure to compare the acceptance of a conventional RCT and an upRCT using thought experiments. The acceptance of the farmers was between 18% and 51%, and the treatment effects of both variants were of comparable size. Our survey suggests that acceptance of the upRCT is about twice as high as the acceptance of the conventional RCT. We discuss that upRCTs are useful when a new measure is introduced or when the upRCT is conducted for several years.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.3.183-199,2020-08-31,69,3,2020,,Articles,ART,,2,Ulrich B.,Morawetz,Christoph,Tribl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,830_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Farmers' Perspectives on the Types of Sales Personnel in the Agricultural Input,en_US,"Personal selling has become even more important as companies are moving towards service- und solution oriented businesses with a strong customer focus. Today, the performance measurement of sales perosnnel goes far beyond quantitative performance indicators und increasingly focuses personal characteristics und competencies of salespersons. While personal sales have already been scientifically investigated in many economic sectors, agricultural economic research is lacking in systematic analysis of behavioural patterns und competencies of salespersons. A survey of 238 agricultural entrepreneurs investigates how they perceive the sales force of the agricultural input industry und how they evaluate their competencies. The results show that three types of salespersons could be identified on the basis of the professional und social competence as well as the sales-oriented personality. 43 % of the evaluated sales representatives of this study can be described as ""sales talents"" with good characteristics of the three success factors. 30 % of sales representatives can be distinguished by their high level of professional competence, while 27 % of sales representatives show weaknesses in all three success factors. Overall, it can be seen that professional competence varies more between the identified salesperson types than social competence und personality.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.3.200-218,2020-08-31,69,3,2020,,Articles,ART,,3,Dorothee,Schulze Schwering,Jan-Philipp,Huchtemann,Philipp,Welter,Eike,Nordmeyer,Achim,Spiller,Dominic,Lemken,,,,,,,,,,,831_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Business Cycle in Agriculture in Poland,en_US,"The main objective of the study was to characterize the business cycle and its particular phases in Polish agriculture and compare with the features of the cycle occurring in theory. The research for the years 2001-2015 which was based on annual real changes in final output allowed to identify three full cycles in Polish agriculture: 1) 2001-2006; 2) 2007-2010; 3) 2011-2015. The analysis of fluctuations showed that all cycles lasted from 4 to 6 years. Growth phases took from 2 to 4 years, and all downward ones lasted 2 years. The amplitudes of these phases were similar. There were both turning points and turning zones in the cycles. The analysis of accumulated dynamics of production, income, prices and investments in particular phases of the business cycle in Polish agriculture shows that in each growth phase all categories have increased. In almost all cycles, the dynamics of these categories in the growth phase was greater than the changes during the downturn. According to the theory of the classical cycle, the value of production as well as agricultural prices changed the most. They had negative dynamics in almost every downward phase. On the other hand, the dynamics of agricultural incomes was positive in all downward phases. Therefore, changes in this category in most cases had the features of the modern cycle. Changes in investments in the downward phases were diversified. The analysis of dynamics indicates that agricultural income and investments in Poland was also affected by the Common Agricultural Policy.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.3.219-230,2020-08-31,69,3,2020,,Articles,ART,,4,Andrzej,Jędruchniewicz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,832_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Implications of Initial Assumptions in Agri-Environmental  Nitrogen Pollution Reduction Policy Design: Quasi-Empirical Evidence from Croatia,en_US,"This paper aims to extend understanding of potential general equilibrium effects of nitrogen pollution reduction policies in multifunctional agriculture. Under the EU Nitrates Directive, to achieve agricultural nitrogen pollution reduction, a country can choose between (or combine) market and command-and-control measures. To deal with nitrate pollution from agricultural sources Croatia uses measures such as input regulations and management practices, rather than market-based measures. This paper evaluates welfare and macroeconomic effects of selected market and command-and-control based agricultural nitrogen reduction policies within Croatian data based CGE model. The paper highlights the importance of usual theoretical assumptions, i.e. labor market cleaning assumption and the degree of substitutability of nitrogen in agricultural production, for policy prescriptions. Namely, the results suggest that agri-environ­mental policy prescriptions largely depend upon labor market cleaning assumption and substitutability of nitrogen in agricultural production. The paper also emphasizes current limitations of CGE models for agri-environmental nitrogen reduction related policies evaluation and highlights the methodological and database development needs for future research.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.4.253-277,2020-11-30,69,4,2020,,Articles,ART,,1,Ozana,Nadoveza Jelić,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,836_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Pig Farming from the Perspective of German Citizens – Comments on Videos of a Pig Fattening Pen,en_US,"There is an increasing discrepancy between agriculture and the population. Studies confirmed that livestock farming has a poor image. In the present study, in an online survey 500 German citizens were shown videos from a pig fattening pen. In addition to the determination of the attitude to the housing system, the survey participants were given the opportunity to comment on the videos. These optional comments were evaluated in a qualitative content analysis. The results show that the housing conditions, especially the stocking density and the slatted floor, were criticised heavily. The way, in which the criticism was formulated, shows that the videos caused different reactions among the participants. While the majority of participants formulated their criticism factually, some comments are more emotional. The expression of attitudes in both forms can be differentiated, explicit and constructive. This indicates that citizens deal with the topic holistically.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.4.278-299,2020-11-30,69,4,2020,,Articles,ART,,2,Anna,Schulze Walgern,Marcus,Mergenthaler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,837_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,How do People look at Pictures of Pigs? Analyzing Fixation Duration Depending on Pig Expression and Barn Type using Eye-Tracking,en_US,"Using eye-tracking, this study investigates fixation duration of students viewing pictures of pigs, which systematically vary in the facial expression of the pig and in the barn setting. The aim of this study is to analyze which picture elements are viewed and for how long, as well as how fixation times vary with a change of the expression of the pig and the barn type. The results show clear effects of picture composition: pig expression and pen type affect fixation durations of different areas of interest with the influence of the pig being considerably larger. Face regions are viewed longer in the “happy” pig, while floor/bedding and the eyes are viewed longer in pictures showing the “unhappy” pig which might be a hint for information search. The power of facial expressions, also for the depiction of farm animals, is a new finding of this paper, which might be of importance when selecting agricultural pictures for different purposes.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.4.300-310,2020-11-30,69,4,2020,,Articles,ART,,3,Sarah,Gauly,Gesa,Busch,Achim,Spiller,Ulrich,Enneking,Susanne,Kunde,Marie,von Meyer-Höfer,,,,,,,,,,,838_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Perception and Classification of Stress Factors of Young Farmers,en_US,"A person of working age spends most of their time at work. A farmer’s workplace is characterized by work in an office, field, or stable, and influenced by a multitude of factors. The working conditions and workloads between individual farms can differ considerably, partly due to differing sizes or respective production specialization. What the exact stress factors in
German agriculture are, how they are perceived by farmers and whether there are differences in perceptions between farmers, is currently an open research question. This is where the present empirical study comes in, in which 290 leaders of agricultural and horticultural enterprises participated. The findings are limited by the fact that the test persons are significantly younger and the farm structures are significantly larger compared to the German average of farmers. Furthermore, the majority of the respondents come from Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. Nevertheless, by forming four factors within the framework of a factor analysis, stressful focal points in agriculture are shown. Furthermore, three clusters can be identified which are characterized both by differences in the perception of stress and sociodemographic characteristics. Younger farmers, in this survey, feel particularly negatively influenced by the social environment (family, neighbors), while high work intensity is a core element among older farmers of this survey. One cluster shows that farmers who perceive stress in a weaker form also feel healthier. These results on the perceptions of burdens in agricultural work show agricultural counsellors and policy makers which measures could relieve pressures and improve farmer health, as well as increasing the attractiveness of activities in agriculture, at least for younger farmers and farmers with larger farms.",,,,10.30430/69.2020.4.311-324,2020-11-30,69,4,2020,,Articles,ART,,4,Mira,Knoop,Ludwig,Theuvsen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,839_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Conflicts about Livestock Farming: Societal-oriented Communication Strategies for the Agri-Food Industry,en_US,"Farmers as well as the agricultural and food industry are confronted with increasingly diverse social requirements regarding livestock farming. In this context, there are environmental and climate protection concerns, but especially the living conditions of the animals are criticized. In addition to the questions of how animal husbandry systems should be developed and how this can be financed, different communicative levels of discussion can be observed. So far, there has been little systematic research concerning the question which communication strategies might be successful. This research gap is addressed in this conceptual paper. Communication strategies from the literature are systematized in a new conceptual way and are illustrated and discussed using practical examples from the agricultural and food industry. Furthermore, practical support is given to choose, apply and evaluate socially oriented communication strategies. This includes a stronger consideration of dialogue-oriented communication processes that combine elements of trust marketing and value discourses.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.1.1-16,2021-02-28,70,1,2021,,Articles,ART,,1,Winnie Isabel,Sonntag,Manuel,Ermann,Achim,Spiller,Marie,von Meyer-Höfer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,843_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,E-Mobility in German Agriculture – A Qualitative Analysis of User Acceptance,en_US,"The development of battery-powered tractor concepts reveals that the topic of electric mobility in agriculture is becoming increasingly relevant. However, it is not yet clear whether these concepts can be established on a broad scale or remain as niches. It is a fact that the future acceptance of e-mobility among farmers will play a key role in this context. But compared to the automotive sector, little is known about the ex-ante user acceptance of electrically powered agricultural machinery. Therefore, this explorative study examines the influencing factors of the ex-ante user acceptance of electrically driven agricultural machinery in a qualitative way in order to contribute to further research on user acceptance. With the help of qualitative expert interviews, 15 farm managers of differently organized agricultural farms were interviewed on this topic. It turns out, that the majority of the interviewees are critical in terms of the distribution and use of e‑mobility in agriculture. On the other hand, it has been shown that the ex-ante user acceptance of electrically powered agricultural machines is not only influenced by various factors, but that they are also linked to each other and thus have an indirect effect on the ex-ante user acceptance of the respondents.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.1.17-35,2021-02-28,70,1,2021,,Articles,ART,,2,Friedrich,Rübcke von Veltheim,Ansgar A.,Rube,Heinke,Heise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,844_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Technical efficiency and productivity change in German large-scale arable farming,en_US,"This paper provides an assessment of technical efficiency and productivity change for a sample of large-scale arable farms in Germany. For this, the paper applies input-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist Index (MI) methods in combination with bootstrapping to a balanced five-year panel data set of 86 German large-scale arable farms over a time period from 2012/2013 to 2016/2017. The DEA results of the original sample show a mean input-saving potential of 9.2 % across farms and time periods. The bootstrapped confidence intervals indicate no statistically significant difference among the mean scores for individual years, however significant differences exist between individual farms. The results of the MI analysis of the original sample suggest a mean annual growth in total factor productivity of 5.4 %. This progress was driven by technical change (6.5 %) and happened despite a small average deterioration in change in technical efficiency (1.1 %). The progress in total factor productivity as well as technical change is statistically underpinned through the bootstrapped confidence intervals. The result of change in technical efficiency computed from the original sample cannot be confirmed statistically as the corresponding confidence interval includes unity.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.1.36-48,2021-02-28,70,1,2021,,Articles,ART,,3,Cord-Friedrich,von Hobe,Marius,Michels,Oliver,Musshoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,845_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Elasticities of Food Demand in Germany – A Demand System Analysis Using Disaggregated Household Scanner Data,en_US,"This paper presents price and income elasticities of food demand for Germany. Using disaggregated household scanner data and the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS). The QUAIDS is modified to account for censoring and include household demographics. Furthermore, a two-stage budgeting approach is used to more accurately reflect households’ purchasing behaviour. Having disaggregated data also allowed to include convenience aspects into the demand system. High expenditure elasticities are found for fruits and nuts and meat, fish and eggs. The highest own-price elasticity is found for beverages. At the second stage, the bread toppings group reveals new insights into demand relations between cold cuts, cheese and other spreads. Cold cuts have both the highest expenditure and own-price elasticity. Cross-price elasticities indicate mostly complementary relations between cold cuts and other bread toppings. Comparing different income groups shows that expenditure elasticities of raw foods or basic ingredient foods tend to decrease as income increases, whereas expenditure elasticities of foods that require minimal or no preparation tend to increase with income. In conclusion, this study stresses the need for regularly updated elasticities of food demand that reflect up-to-date consumption behavior.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.1.49-62,2021-02-28,70,1,2021,,Articles,ART,,4,Jonas,Peltner,Silke,Thiele,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,846_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Development of Supply Curves for Biodiversity Offsets on  Agricultural Land – a Case Study from the Stuttgart Region,en_US,"Impacts on nature and landscape are to be offset in accordance with different nature conservation acts in various European countries. In Germany in particular, biodiversity offsets can also be made in advance, for instance, by booking them into eco-accounts, and then allocating them to an intervention. In Baden-Württemberg, these offset measures are assessed in eco credits in accordance with the Eco Account Regulation (ÖKVO). As a means of income diversification, farmers can voluntarily implement offset measures on their land, and then generate and sell corresponding eco credits. Using a geodata-based model, the potential for implementing biodiversity offsets on arable land – areas with major eco credit potential – is analysed from an economic perspective. The Stuttgart Region is a steadily growing conurbation in south-west Germany. It serves as a study region since the loss of farmland due to large-scale construction measures and the related offsetting are a major issue here. In the analysis, the gross margins of the crops grown, their yield capacity, the associated standard land values and the costs of possible offset measures are used to determine the net present value of the arable land at parcel level. From a theoretical point of view and depending on the market price for eco credits, there is a significant potential for offset measures on arable land. Production-integrated compensation (PIC) – an extensification of arable land use – is less economically viable than the conversion of arable land into grassland or its utilisation for nature conservation. There are major spatial disparities between the city of Stuttgart and the surrounding districts. The implementation of biodiversity offsets is not economically viable at a price of less than € 1.00 per eco credit in the city of Stuttgart. By contrast, in surrounding districts, offset measures may be economically viable and implemented on a large scale for less than € 0.30. This is particularly relevant as the districts concerned are located in the same natural area as the city of Stuttgart and the eco credits can, therefore, be attributed in the event of interventions. Based on derived supply curves, decision-makers can see the scale of additional costs of biodiversity offset measures if they are implemented in a spatially restricted region.

Livestock in the EU are frequently given feed containing imported genetically modified (GM) crops, with GM fodder often being cheaper for farmers. However, there is also a growing market for ‘GM-free’ animal-based products. While public concerns about GMOs have been studied extensively, less is known about farmers’ views. The limited literature on farmers and GMOs tends to focus on the economic factors influencing their adoption. The present study contributes the perspective of farmers as members of the general public, thus including a broader set of factors known to be relevant for the public perception of GMOs. The results indicated that farmers were worried about: i) unforeseen consequences for the environment, ii) un­foreseen consequences for human and animal health, and iii) the dominance of multinational companies. Farmers who could expect their farm businesses to benefit from existing GMOs were more positive, whereas those who were unlikely to experience any benefits or who could expect their farm business to be adversely affected were more negative. Nevertheless, adherence to a broader set of positive or negative values suggests that Swedish farmers’ perspectives on GMOs go further than pure considerations of farm management.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.2.84-100,2021-05-31,70,2,2021,,Articles,ART,,2,Klara,Fischer,Sebastian,Hess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,859_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Online Purchases of Plant Protection Products: A Discrete Choice Experiment with Agricultural Entrepreneurs in Germany,en_US,"Digitalization is progressing more and more and increasingly influencing business processes in companies. In this context, e-commerce plays an important role for the future development of rural areas. Nonetheless, there is so far no study which investigates the use of e-commerce for business purposes in rural areas. Hence, primary data was collected from 250 farmers by conducting a discrete choice experiment about the purchase of crop protection products. The ""willingness to accept"" (WTA) of agricultural entrepreneurs for e-commerce was estimated using a mixed logit model. The results show that agricultural entrepreneurs demand a discount when they purchase inputs via online trading rather than from their current trader. Furthermore, the presence of a private respectively state label for an online retailer has a positive effect on e-commerce usage. However, the longer delivery time has a negative effect on the use of e-commerce for crop protection product purchases. The results show that consultation and personal contact between the dealer and the customer are of great importance. These core findings are very relevant to business practice, as they provide online agricultural traders of agricultural inputs with initial clues regarding appropriate marketing measures and allow de-riving recommendations for policy measures. In addition, by considering individual-specific characteristics, it could be shown that there is a statistically significant relationship between the risk attitude and education level with the e-commerce acceptance of an agricultural entrepreneur.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.2.101-122,2021-05-31,70,2,2021,,Articles,ART,,3,Michael,Danne,Wilm,Fecke,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,860_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,A Primer on p-Value Thresholds and α-Levels – Two Different Kettles of Fish,en_US,"It has often been noted that the “null-hypothesis-significance-testing” (NHST) framework is an inconsistent hybrid of Neyman-Pearson’s “hypothesis testing” and Fisher’s “significance testing” that almost inevitably causes misinterpretations. To facilitate a realistic assessment of the potential and the limits of statistical inference, we briefly recall widespread inferential errors and outline the two original approaches of these famous statisticians. Based on the understanding of their irreconcilable perspectives, we propose “going back to the roots” and using the initial evidence in the data in terms of the size and the uncertainty of the estimate for the purpose of statistical inference. Finally, we make six propositions that hopefully contribute to improving the quality of inferences in future research.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.2.123-133,2021-05-31,70,2,2021,,Articles,ART,,4,Norbert,Hirschauer,Sven,Grüner,Oliver,Mußhoff,Claudia,Becker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,861_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,"The Impact of Dietary Changes on Agriculture, Trade, Environment and Health: A Literature Review",en_US,"Animal-source foods are a major component of global diets and are increasingly criticised because of their adverse impacts on environment, climate and health. A shift in diets towards plant-based foods is a discussed option to overcome these problems. Much of the scientific emphasis so far has been on estimating the potential of such a dietary change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve health outcomes while less attention has been attracted on studies analysing the impacts on agricultural markets. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and, therefore, summarizes existing studies on the effects of a reduced consumption of animal-source foods on agricultural markets, greenhouse gas emissions, food security and health. In addition, available studies on the so‑called rebound effect are presented. The identified studies suggest that a reduction in the consumption of meat in the EU or OECD would lead to a 1‑10% decrease in meat world market prices, depending on the magnitude and particularities of the assumed dietary changes. This would translate to a 3‑10% reduction in production. The lower domestic demand for meat could also negatively affect welfare outcomes and GDP. However, it has to be mentioned that these studies do not take into account the consequences of improved environmental and health conditions. In fact, our review indicates that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could generally be proportional to the magnitude of plant-based diets. The maximum reduction potentials of 60-70% could be found for global vegetarian or vegan diets. However, some studies indicate that a shift in food expenditure towards other resource-intensive goods could lead to a rebound effect. Further, this overview suggests that environmental and public health objectives might be in alignment as all identified studies indicate that a reduction in meat consumption in high‑income countries could be associated with lower rates of mortality and non-communicable diseases. This overview reveals the complex relationships between food demand, agricultural supply, international trade, environment, health and food security.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.3.139-164,2021-07-13,70,3,2021,,Articles,ART,,1,Inna,Geibel,Florian,Freund,Martin,Banse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,863_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Abating Ammonia Emissions through Slurry Acidification during Spreading: Farmers’ Willingness to Participate in a Support Scheme,en_US,"This article sought to determine farmers’ willingness to join a hypothetical support scheme for slurry acidification during spreading. Slurry acidification is a novel technique to reduce ammonia emissions, which has been pioneered in Denmark. In an online discrete choice survey of German livestock farmers, the respondents were asked to choose between different policy schemes to promote the use of acidification techniques and an opt-out option. The support schemes were characterized by the following attributes: cost share, expected emission reduction as well as a relief from, and a tightening of, the German Fertilizer Ordinance. The relief was a waiver of the legal requirement to incorporate slurry immediately after spreading. The tightening related to the provision to account for the additional nitrogen in a farmer’s fertilizer planning. The data was estimated using a mixed logit model and latent class analysis. The estimated probability of choosing a support scheme was 90 % in the mixed logit estimation. All attributes were crucial for the decision to use acidification techniques during slurry spreading. Higher emission reduction increased the chances of participation in a support scheme significantly. Furthermore, the cost share offered and the exemption from the requirement to incorporate slurry immediately after spreading had a significantly positive impact on farmers’ willingness to participate. By contrast, the more of the extra nitrogen contained in acidified slurry had to be accounted for in a farmer’s fertilizer planning, the lower the probability of participation.",,,,10.30430/70.2021.3.192-207,2021-07-13,70,3,2021,,Articles,ART,,4,Insa,Thiermann,Gunnar,Breustedt,Uwe,Latacz-Lohmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,866_org.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Economic Well-being of Farm Households in Germany,en_US,"In this study, we explore the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households in Germany. We applied an indicator that combines households' disposable income and net wealth consisting of financial assets and real estate to data from the Income and Consumption Survey (EVS) 2018. We found that the income available to farm households can support a standard of living equal to that of nonfarm (employed) households. Wealth affects households' economic well-being in both directions: farm households and workers/employees would be better off if their household income would assess their economic status. The opposite trend occurs for unem-ployed and pensioners/retirees. However, the analysis of farmers' well-being requires income data of multiple years regarding the income volatility of self-employment in agriculture. Consid-ering wealth to assess farm households' economic well-being means paying attention to their farm assets because they are highly intertwined with the household. The EVS misses farm char-acteristics and a reliable number of farmers' observations to assess their economic well-being over time to derive agricultural policy implications. Hence, there is currently a lack of statistical data and evidence to achieve the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 's second objective to pro-vide income support in a targeted manner.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2021.0090,2021-09-15,70,4,2021,,Articles,ART,,1,Sabrina,Bethge,Jost-Frederik,Wendt,Sebastian,Lakner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0090.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Market Power in Agricultural Land Markets: Concepts and Empirical Challenges,en_US,"This paper provides review about challenges and opportunities to assess and quantify market power in agricultural land markets. Measuring land market power is challenging because the characteristics of this production factor hinder the direct application of familiar concepts from commodity markets. Immobility, fixed availability, and large heterogeneity of land and potential users contradict assumptions of fictitious point market for homogeneous goods. Moreover, the use of concentration indicators for policy assessments is hampered by two problems. First, defining the relevant regional size of the market is challenging and concentration indicators are not robust with regard to market size and number of actors. Second, high concentration of land ownership or land operation may point at potential market power, but it may also be the result of an efficient allocation of land due to structural change in agriculture. The aforementioned challenges are illustrated with a case study for the Federal State of Brandenburg in Germany. Using available data for land sales, a regression analysis reveals a negative relationship between land use concentration and farmland prices. This result can be interpreted as an indication of market power on the buyer side in agricultural land markets. However, it is hardly possible to translate this finding into recommendations for land market regulations because the evaluation of the potential misuse of dominant positions in land markets requires a case-specific analysis. Providing evidence for the exertion of market power in land markets is extremely complex and deserves further attention from researchers and politicians.</span></p>",,,,10.30430/gjae.2021.0117,2021-09-23,70,4,2021,,Articles,ART,,2,Alfons,Balmann,Marten,Graubner,Daniel,Müller,Silke,Hüttel,Stefan,Seifert,Martin,Odening,Jana,Plogmann,Matthias,Ritter,,,,,,,GJAE_0117.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Identifying and Debunking Environmentally-Related False News Stories – An Experimental Investigation,en_US,"The vast majority of studies in the realm of false information are currently conducted in the realm of political topics and Covid-19. This study addresses environmentally-related news stories. With the help of two experiments, I explore determinants that can explain who is good at distinguishing between accurate (i.e., factually correct) and false information and compare several intervention scenarios to debunk false information. In experiment one, subjects had to rate environmentally-related news stories as accurate or false. Afterward, subjects received systematically varied information about the correctness of the news stories depending on the experimental condition they had been randomly assigned to. After a period of three weeks, the subjects were asked to evaluate the news stories again (experiment two). In experiment one, I find that the perceived familiarity with news stories increased the propensity to accept them as true. Moreover, actively open-minded thinking helped to distinguish between accurate and false information. But the willingness to think deliberately did not seem to be important. In experiment two, it can be found that by repeating false news stories, subjects were more likely to adequately identify them later (i.e., no evidence for a familiarity backfire effect). However, it decreased the likelihood to adequately identify accurate news stories. A somewhat reverse, but weaker effect occurred when factually correct news stories were repeated: the correct identification of accurate news stories was more successful, but the opposite holds for the identification of false news stories.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2021.0176,2021-11-18,70,4,2021,,Articles,ART,,5,Sven,Grüner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0176.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Farmers’ Willingness to Accept Animal Welfare Practices: A Discrete Choice Experiment with German Pig Producers,en_US,"Improving the welfare of animals is an important aim in livestock farming. Thereby, farmers’ willingness to implement animal welfare practices directly influences the welfare of animals. Therefore, this paper investigates pig farmers’ preferences and willingness to accept the implementation of animal welfare practices. We study individual preferences for specific animal welfare measures that are part of a hypothetical animal welfare program. The data are analyzed with a mixed logit model in WTA space and show that German pig farmers require statistically significant compensations for implementing animal welfare practices. We find evidence that farmers’ choices are driven by their trust in the consumers’ willingness to pay, their evaluation of the efficiency of specific animal welfare practices and farm characteristics. Our results further reveal that accounting for farmers’ preferences aids in understanding their willingness to implement specific animal welfare practices. Regarding the improvement of animal welfare these findings are highly relevant for politicians, food industry and producers in order to support animal welfare program design and to identify the costs of welfare improvements on the meat supply chain and future profitability.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0158,2022-02-18,71,1,2022,,Articles,ART,,2,Michael,Danne,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0158.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Risk Preferences and the Adoption of Subsidised Crop Insurance: Evidence from Lithuania,en_US,"Crop insurance adoption remains low among small and medium farms – despite financial public support in the form of premium subsidies. A better understanding of smaller farmers’ insurance decisions and contract attribute preferences is thus needed to encourage insurance solutions. Moreover, previous research has primarily examined risk preferences and insurance adoption among Western European farmers, while little is known about insurance markets and risk preferences in Central and Eastern European countries. We contribute to the literature by i) contrasting the current status of insurance adoption by Lithuanian farmers by farm size, ii) assessing farmers’ risk preferences and attitudes towards crop insurance, and iii) investigating small and medium farmers’ preferences for the characteristics of a new (hypothetical) subsidised multiple peril crop insurance (MPCI) product. Therefore, we conduct a socio-economic survey in Lithuania that features a risk preference elicitation task and a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Findings show that, on average, sampled farmers are risk-neutral to slightly risk-seeking and that insurance adoption is lowest among smaller farms (50 hectares). Moreover, insurance adoption was associated with higher risk exposure, higher trust in insurance services, and higher willingness to take farming-specific risks on all farms. For small and medium farms, the DCE results suggest preference heterogeneity for contract attributes and higher adoption rates when contract design reduces the risks and efforts associated with subsidised insurance.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0125,2022-02-28,71,1,2022,,Articles,ART,,4,Birgit,Gassler,Regina,Rehermann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0125.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Der Markt für Fleisch und Fleischprodukte 2021/2022,de_DE,"The year 2021 shows a division between the development of the different global meat markets. Fueled by the Chinese market there was a strong demand for beef in particular coupled with a limited supply which results in strongly increased prices for beef and beef products. The same occurred on the meat markets of mutton and goat. On the contrary, there was a steady demand for pork but also a big increase in pork production, again driven by the expansion in China. As Chinese importers began to shorten their orders, prices of pork went down in the second half of 2021. Regarding the poultry markets there is a more balanced development of supply and demand. The EU-27 pork and poultry meat production increased a bit in 2021 compared to 2020 while beef production shrunk slightly. There are strong differences between the member states. In particular Spain, Poland, Ireland and the Netherlands realized a remarkable expansion of meat production. In sum, EU consumption is stagnating. The German pork market faces extraordinary challenges. Weak demand for pork in the last few years is coupled with continuous discussion about pig farming and working conditions in slaughterhouses and the meat industry. The Corona pandemic and adding to that the outbreak of African Swine Fever in September 2020 led to serious marketing problems and a downward trend for pig and pork prices. Contrary to that, cattle and beef markets achieve – as on the international markets- huge price increases. The domestic production did not respond with production expansion for now because the milk market causes the rather continuous decline of beef production and changes in production have a long time-delay. The German poultry market is expansive both in production and consumption. The actual situation and short-term development of the market of meat alternatives shows a still relatively young and less established market with marginal market shares in the different product markets.",,,,10.30430/71.2022.5.Fleisch,2022-04-14,71,Supplement,2022,,Articles supplement,ASup,,5,Josef,Efken,Jakob,Meemken,Inken,Christoph-Schulz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_2022_5_Fleisch.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

The most frequent UTPs are late payments (39.6%), payments unrelated to a specific transaction (39.6%), and unilateral changes by buyers in contracts and orders. The results of the probit model show that producer organisations decrease the probability of UTPs relative to conditions in which the main buyer is a private trader (by 32%) or supermarket (by 35%).

,How much Meat do we eat? Estimating per Capita Meat Consumption in Germany based on a Market Balance Approach,en_US,"Meat consumption has become increasingly relevant within the greater scientific, political, and public debate due to the variety of negative effects that it has on the environment, human health, and animal welfare. In Germany, the statistical basis for “direct consumption” entails uncertainties and is based on parameters dating back to 1987. The following study deals with an updated and revised estimate of the per capita consumption of pork, beef, and poultry in Germany, focusing on the supply-side. Unlike the original approach, the estimate is based on a mass flow analysis. It includes a survey at the slaughterhouse level, adjustments to external trade statistics, and assumptions on loss and waste at five different value chain stages. An average total per capita meat consumption of 65 kg is calculated for the year 2018. Thus, meat consumption has been underestimated by 4 kg per capita based on official statistics by overestimating waste, losses, and non-food uses. Our results provide information regarding per capita and total meat consumption, enable future projections, and give an overview of the use of meat outside the food chain. The approach used is discussed against the background of international comparability and applicability. In this way the study provides important indications for political decision-makers and contributes to more objectivity in the public debate on meat consumption.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0182,2022-05-23,71,2,2022,,Articles,ART,,3,Annika Johanna,Thies,Josef,Efken,Monika,Sönnichsen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0182.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Considering Environmental Factors in Technical Efficiency Analysis of European Crop Production,en_US,"Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a popular tool to determine technical efficiency of agricultural production. One issue that arises in some nonparametric frameworks is the heterogenous endowment with determinate factors, such as agroclimatic conditions. Environmental factors clearly lie outside of the sphere of influence of the decision-maker and pose natural limits to increasing efficiency and productivity of agricultural production. Calls for rationalization or better allocation of production inputs might thus not be adequate if concerned studies do not properly account for exogeneous factors of efficiency. The presented paper addresses the existing attempts to deal with the issue and analyzes the effect of soil quality on technical efficiency, calculated for crop producers of 122 European regions (FADN), using a regularly employed two-stage DEA framework. The effect of soil quality is then accounted for by adjusting the input factor land by a land quality factor. First, results show that environmental factors, e.g., soil quality, have a significant positive effect on technical efficiency. Further, the proposed land adjustment reveals structurally different results for some individual efficiency estimates, which indicates that neglecting the effect of environmental factors on efficiency might yield misleading policy implications.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0222,2022-07-08,71,2,2022,,Articles,ART,,4,Alexander,Kaiser,Axel,Schaffer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0222.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Why did Ukraine become a Key Player on the World Agri-Food Markets? An Enterprise-Level Perspective,en_US,"Over the past decades, Ukraine has built an increasingly dynamic agricultural sector, characterized by growing export engagement in various commodities. Whether the country can quickly regain its status of a key player on the world agri-food markets amid and after Russian invasion is extremely important for international food security. However, the to-date understanding of the recovery potential remains elusive due to the lack of systematic and objective insights into the major drivers of recent growth. Scarce evidence suggests that Ukraine’s agriculture has been successfully modernized mainly due to the efforts of private sector actors operating in the context of generally inconsequent policies typical of a transition country. The following factors have been reported to contribute to recent modernization and development of the sector: a) improvement of efficiency and productivity, especially in crop production; b) structural change involving a rapid development of large-scale agroholdings; and c) relatively positive public acceptance of modern technologies and organizational forms of agricultural production. The present paper reviews these trends in greater detail by addressing the role of professional farm management, digital technologies, ongoing optimization of the size of production operations (including horizontal and vertical integration through merger and acquisitions) as well as farm engagement in sustainability and legitimation activities as the main enterprise-level drivers of growth and resilience in Ukrainian agriculture.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0302,2022-08-22,71,3,2022,,Articles,ART,,3,Taras,Gagalyuk,Igor,Ostapchuk,Volodymyr,Lapa,Alfons,Balmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0302.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Impact of the War in Ukraine on Farm Profitability and the Attractiveness of Environmental Measures in Germany,en_US,"The war in Ukraine has led to massive price increases for agricultural inputs and products. This paper examines the effects on farm profitability and the consequences for the adoption of eco-schemes on arable farms. We use the large farm sample of the German Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) to identify the average income effects and to highlight the heterogeneity of the effects and their drivers. Building on these results, we analyse farms’ adaptation strategies with a focus on changes in nitrogen input intensity and participation in environmental measures (“eco-schemes”) of the new Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). Our results suggest that income effects are heterogeneous and subject to considerable uncertainty about the near future, and that many farms are likely to benefit from the short-term price effects of the war in Ukraine. Against this background, the efficiency of financial assistance under the EU crisis reserve would have benefited from a stronger focus on liquidity loans and ex-post hardship support. Our analysis also shows strong implications for participation in eco-schemes. The results cast significant doubts on the effectiveness and efficiency of the eco-schemes introduced by the new CAP, beyond the observed impact of the war in Ukraine.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0300,2022-08-22,71,3,2022,,Articles,ART,,4,Raphaela,Ellßel,Friedrich,Wüstemann,Frank,Offermann,Thomas,de Witte,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0300.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Implications of Russia’s War in Ukraine for the Global Agri-Food Sector – An Ex-Ante Assessment using Different Simulation Models,en_US,"In light of Russia’s war in Ukraine, three widely used trade and sector models were applied to assess: i) global food and nutrition security, ii) the effects on the bioeconomy, and iii) the implications for the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Simulation results show that an export stop of agri-food commodities in Ukraine and Russia results in a substantial increase in global agri-food prices under short-term assumptions. However, the longer-term effects are much smaller due to global supply responses. The effects on food security depend on the importance of cereals in countries’ diets. Furthermore, due to subsequent Gross Domestic Product declines, there may be further negative long-term implications for food security, especially in Africa. An additional scenario with a 10% increase in the global oil price shows that European Union (EU) biofuel production is heavily affected. The implementation of the initially envisaged CAP requirement of a set-aside of 4% of the farmed area would have little effect on EU cereal production, whereas a 10% reduction in fertiliser availability in the EU would lead to a decline in net production of cereals. A joint reduction in pig herd size and pork consumption could partly mitigate the negative consequences of reduced fertiliser availability, otherwise leakage would occur either through the import of pork into the EU for consumption or the production of EU pork meat for export markets. To mitigate the market effects of the war, EU policymakers should: i) encourage efficient (animal) nutrient use to offset fertiliser shortages and land use choices that increase
market availability of food crops, ii) encourage restructuring of animal production in line with consumption developments to prevent leakage effects and ensure that non-food products are used efficiently as feed products, and iii) support vulnerable households to secure short-term food access.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0310,2022-08-30,71,3,2022,,Articles,ART,,5,Marvin,Berndt,Kirsten,Boysen-Urban,Simon,Ehjeij,Amelia,Espey,Arndt,Feuerbacher,Dorothee,Flaig,Tobias,Heimann,Sebastian,Hess,Markus,Kempen,Franziska,Schünemann,Christine,Wieck,GJAE_0310.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Implementing an Approximation of Cumulative Prospect Theory into Mixed Linear Programming – an Application to Bio-Economic Modelling at Farm-Scale Considering Crop Insurance,en_US,"Many empirical studies have found Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) superior in depicting risk behavior compared to the expected utility approach and literature now offers also CPT related parameter estimates for European farmers. CPT combines two segments of utility functions, a convex, risk loving one for losses and a concave, risk averse one for gains, and assigns subjective weights to the pay-offs according to their cumulative probabilities. So far, no implementation of CPT into constrained optimization problems exists, allowing for instance, the simulation of risk management under CPT in farm-scale programming models. To close this gap, we propose to combine endogenous sorting of the pay-offs based on integer variables with a piece-wise linear approximation of the value function using SOS2 (Special Ordered Sets of Type 2) variables. The SOS2 variables are required to deal with the convexity of the loss segment of the utility function. The integer sorting assigns the weights to the pay-offs according to their cumulative probabilities, it requires that all pay-offs are equally likely. Simulating optimal uptake levels of variants of a hypothetical crop insurance product with an evolved bio-economic model at farm-scale serves a proof of concept. The model considers adjustments in the cropping plan and allows for partial insurance coverage, in opposite to existing studies which evaluate the uptake of crop insurance at fixed crop choices and depict coverage as a yes-no decision.

The approximation error of the approach is found as negligible small and the numerical burden compared to optimization under risk neutrality as still acceptable. The proposed approximation approach is quite general and applicable for any utility function increasing in the pay-off value and does not require its differentiability. It can also be applied without probability weighting. The empirical application underlines that the approach generates the expected behavior when a risk reducing strategy, here crop insurance, is considered under CPT. Insured acreage generally increases with higher strike levels where more frequently occurring but lower crop damages are covered, and with reduced cost of the insurance products. Using crop insurance as a risk management strategy is found to interact with other measures such as adjustments in cropping shares. This underlines the usefulness of an approach which allows to optimize interacting risk management strategies at farm-scale under CPT, considering resource and other relevant constraints.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0244,2022-08-26,71,4,2022,,Articles,ART,,1,Wolfgang,Britz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0244.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Farmers’ Preferences for Fertilizers derived from Domestic Sewage and Kitchen Waste – A Discrete Choice Experiment in Germany,en_US,"In view of increasing energy and resource scarcities, nutrient recycling from domestic wastewater is a promising way to obtain mineral fertilizers. Given the lacking evidence about the acceptance of recycling fertilizers by the farming sector, we elicited farmer preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for selected attributes of mineral fertilizers made from domestic sewage and kitchen waste. We conducted a Discrete Choice Experiment with 206 German farmers and fitted a Random Parameter Logit (RPL) model. As-suming an average market price level of around 300 euros per tonne of N-P-K fertilizer, the choice exper-iment revealed that farmers not engaged in non-food production such as forage cultivation or renewable energies activities and without farmer-to-consumer direct marketing would accept a recycling fertilizer only together with a financial compensation via price discount of approximately 10%. The average WTP drops considerably if a fertilizer’s heavy metal contents are relatively high and if the absence of drug residues cannot be guaranteed, whereas a customizable nutrient composition and a constant supply availability would have a sales promoting effect. Farmers’ characteristics can only partly explain the notable heterogeneity of the WTP for the considered fertilizer attributes. Even though the WTP for a recycling fertilizer is on average less than that for a conventional mineral fertilizer, the estimated WTP standard deviations suggest that not all farmers expect a financial compensation via price discount when purchasing recycling fertilizers.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0235,2022-09-21,71,4,2022,,Articles,ART,,2,Katrin,Utai,Manuel,Narjes,Tatjana,Krimly,Christian,Lippert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0235.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Beyond P-Value-Obsession: When are Statistical Hypothesis Tests Required and Appropriate?,en_US,"Complementing more specific “p-value discussions”, this paper presents fundamental arguments for when null hypothesis statistical significance tests (NHST) are required and appropriate. The arguments, which are paradigmatic rather than technical, are operationalised and broken down to the extent that their logic can be mapped into a decision tree for the use of NHST. We derive a perspective that does not ban p-values but proposes to minimize their use. P-values will become rather rare in (agricultural) economics if they are not applied in any cases, where the conditions for their proper use are violated or where their use is not appropriate or required in order to answer the questions asked of the data. The accompanying shift from prioritising inferential statistics to recognising the value of descriptive statistics requires not only a change in entrenched habits of thought. This shift also has the potential to trigger changes in the research processes and in the evaluation of new approaches within the disciplines.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0283,2022-10-21,71,4,2022,,Articles,ART,,3,Anne,Margarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0283.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Using Auxiliary Information to Improve Agricultural Statistics – Advantages of the Calibration Approach over Poststratification Weights,en_US,"Official statistics are often based on samples representing a certain population. Because participation in a sample is usually voluntary, bias might result from so-called non-sampling errors such as nonresponse. Weighting procedures are intended to correct these errors by assigning a certain weight to each observation in the sample. In many official agricultural statistics, such as the Bavarian Agricultural Report, poststratification is used. In this process, the population is stratified according to different dimensions (e.g. farm type, farm location and farm size) and weights are assigned to all farms in a stratum so that the sum of the weights in that stratum corresponds to the number of observations in that stratum in the population. However, when estimating the population average, important characteristics (such as the farm size) may still be biased. Using a Bavarian farm sample, the present study shows how the so-called calibration approach, utilising auxiliary variables to adjust weights, outperforms the poststratification procedure in terms of estimating important population characteristics.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2022.0294,2022-11-30,71,4,2022,,Articles,ART,,7,Lucian,Stanca,Daniel,Hoop,Johannes,Sauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0294.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The Behavior of Agricultural Decision-Makers towards the Adoption of Sustainable Process Innovations in Germany,en_US,"In reaction to new challenges of shifting sustainability requirements and climate change in the agricultural sector, sustainable process innovations are a way to combine food production with diverse ecosystem services. Despite their advantages, which have long been described in research, the actual adoption rates of these innovations in agricultural practice in Germany are rather low. In order to promote their wider dissemination, the question concerning the so far rarely investigated adoption factors of sustainable process innovations in agriculture is of particular importance. It is the aim of the present study to determine the affiliation of agricultural decision-makers to the different adoption stages ‘precontemplation’, ‘contemplation’, ‘preparation’ and ‘action’ of sustainable process innovations, using the example of agroforestry systems, and to illustrate the influence of various farmer and farm characteristics as adoption factors on the affiliation of farmers to those stages. Based on quantitative survey data of 209 German farmers, the transtheoretical model of behavior change is applied to the adoption of innovations using descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis and ordinal regression analysis. The results show that at the currently dominating low adoption levels, farmers’ attitude towards the implementation of agroforestry systems on their own farms as an adoption factor has the strongest positive influence on the adoption. While existing experiences with renewable energies also have a positive influence on the adoption, the opposite is true for previous experiences with short rotation coppice (SRC) and agroforestry systems (AFS). From a regional perspective, a higher adoption probability can be observed in southern Germany. Based on the results, the following targeted measures are developed to further disseminate innovative land use systems through improving farmers’ attitude and to establish a group of pioneer farmers: Improvement of communication about requirements and potentials of innovations; stronger anchoring of sustainable process innovations in the curricula of agricultural vocational training and of study programs; establishment of permanent training and professional development offers; establishment of long-term, low-threshold subsidy programs; and regional differentiation of measures.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0122,2023-01-20,72,1,2023,,Articles,ART,,1,Verena,Otter,Maximilian,Deutsch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0122.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,An Analysis of Success Factors for German Farmstead Dairies,en_US,"Farmstead dairies are a small but growing segment in the German dairy market, but there is little information about them. They produce and process milk from their own farm or additionally from a small number of farms from the surrounding area and market it under their own brands. Thus, farmstead dairies offer an alternative for milk producers who wish to generate added value for their milk. Although developing a farmstead dairy with marketing takes time and money and involves some risk, it offers dairy farms an opportunity to be less dependent on outside dairies, to stabilise or increase their income, and to spread their risk. Yet, only limited knowledge is available regarding success factors and their effect on the success of farmstead dairies. The present study addresses this research gap by conducting an online survey of farmstead dairies in Germany to analyse the influence of various internal and external factors on the success of this type of dairy. The results revealed that organic production, a larger processing volume and a product portfolio comprising both Yellow Line and White Line products have a positive effect on success. Furthermore, good cooperation between farmstead dairies and their veterinarians located in a region with a relatively prosperous population and a high population density contributes to the success of farmstead dairies. In addition, the results showed that increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has had a positive impact on their success. The results show that there are several starting points for farmstead dairy managers to positively influence the success of their businesses. At the same time, however, there are also a number of factors over which they have no influence.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0285,2023-01-27,72,1,2023,,Articles,ART,,2,Janina,Knuck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0285.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Farmers’ Attitudes toward the Future of Direct Payments: An Empirical Study from Germany,en_US,"The new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform has met with large-scale protests from farmers throughout Europe, intending to change one of the most controversial components: direct payments. We analyze German farmers' attitudes and understanding of direct payments. The study employs a survey of 435 farmers collected from January to February 2021. Using cluster analysis and quantitative content analysis, we identified three distinct groups: (1) The “Independents” (43.7%) are entrepreneurs and have a competitive mindset. They would prefer to abolish direct payments associated with more freedom from policy conditions. (2) The “Conservatives” (27.0%) advocate an income policy based on direct payments, and they reject higher environmental standards. (3) The “Environmentalists” (30.3%) emphasize a pronounced environmental awareness, fa-voring an environmentally performance-based approach. The results show that policies are often perceived differently than they are intentionally designed. Improving the effectiveness of the policy measure requires sufficient information about the CAP's objectives for farmers, focusing on more transparent communication strategies. From a policy perspective, a more differentiated design of policy instruments and longer transformation periods are needed to engage farmers in policy change.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0268,2023-02-24,72,1,2023,,Articles,ART,,5,Sabrina,Bethge,Sebastian,Lakner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0268.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The p-Value Debate and Statistical (Mal)practice – Implications for the Agricultural and Food Economics Community,en_US,"A vivid debate is ongoing in the scientific community about statistical malpractice and the related publication bias. No general consensus exists on the consequences and this is reflected in heterogeneous rules defined by scientific journals on the use and reporting of statistical inference. This paper aims at providing an overview on the debate, discussing how it is perceived by the agricultural economics community, and deriving implications for our roles as researchers, contributors to the scientific publication process, and teachers. Following a ‘Mixed Methods Review’, we start by summarizing the current state of the p-value debate in the context of the replication crisis and commonly applied statistical practices in our community. This is followed by motivation, design, results and discussion of an explorative and descriptive survey on statistical knowledge and practice among the researchers in the agricultural economics community in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Instead of providing specific guidelines or rules, we derive implications for our roles in the scientific process to support a needed long-term cultural change regarding empirical scientific practices. Acceptance of scientific work should largely be based on the theoretical and methodological rigor and where the perceived relevance arises from the questions asked, the methodology employed, and the data used but not from the results generated. Revised and clear journal guidelines, the creation of resources for teaching and research, and public recognition of good practice are suggested measures to move forward.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0231,2023-03-03,72,1,2023,,Articles,ART,,6,Thomas,Heckelei,Silke,Hüttel,Martin,Odening,Jens,Rommel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0231.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Der Markt für Zucker 2022,en_US,"In the sugar marketing year 2021/22 (MY, Oct.-Sept.) the recovery in world market prices for raw and white sugar observed in the previous year slowed significantly. This development was mainly driven by macroeconomic uncertainties. In the first months of the marketing year, news about new corona strains has fueled concerns about further prolonged lockdowns. Towards the end of the marketing year sharply rising inflation rates, which were expected to lead to a significant weakening of demand, put pressure on prices. Thus, the upward trend in global sugar prices slowed down in the 2021/22 sugar marketing year, despite a tight global supply. In the coming months, prices could even come under further pressure, as the global sugar market is expected to turn into surplus in the marketing year 2022/23. An increase in production is expected in particular for Brazil and Thailand, whereas due to dry weather conditions production of the EU-27 is estimated to decline compared to the previous year. Hence, in contrast to the world market, the EU sugar market remains in deficit, which could support prices in the coming months. Already towards the end of the 2021/22 marketing year, the EU sugar price soared and reached roughly the level of the 2016/17 marketing year, the last year before production quotas were lifted in the EU. Despite rising prices, however, the consolidation of the EU sugar market following the abolition of production quotas for sugar and isoglucose is still ongoing. In the 2021/22 marketing year, Germany was the largest sugar-producing country in the EU for the second consecutive year, overtaking France in the ranking of the largest EU sugar-producing countries. Poland was able to defend its position. The development of the EU isoglucose market was less dynamic. If, however, the supply situation in the EU remains tight and prices continue to rise, the supply gap could be closed not only by increasing sugar imports but also by a growing market share for isoglucose. The EU sweetener market may therefore afford some surprising future developments.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.5.Zucker,2023-04-12,72,Supplement,2023,,Articles supplement,ASup,,2,Marlen,Haß,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_2023_5_Zucker.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,E-Commerce in German Agriculture: A Case Study Investigating Farmer Satisfaction Applying the Thinking Aloud Method,en_US,"E-commerce in agriculture is gaining increasing attention, but market penetration is currently low, and companies are barely exploiting its full potential. Identifying and satisfying farmers’ expectations of e-commerce websites for farm inputs is crucial to reduce this opportunity loss. This paper presents a qualitative case study using the “thinking aloud” method, investigating the factors of an agricultural e-commerce site that need to be improved to increase customer satisfaction. The results reveal that farmers’ dissatisfaction with and reluctance to engage in agricultural e-commerce are linked to deficiencies in the store design. These deficiencies are especially apparent in the incongruent design of off- and online stores. Congruity is needed not only in terms of price but, more importantly, in terms of design (e.g., navigation, product order) and services. However, this is often lacking. High channel congruence improves trust in the online provider and keeps perceived transaction costs low. The study emphasizes the importance of customer centricity and a channel integration strategy in agricultural trade and provides indications of which elements lead to higher customer satisfaction.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0200,2023-03-21,72,2,2023,,Articles,ART,,1,Dorothee,Schulze Schwering,Lena,Focke-Meermann,Achim,Spiller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0200.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Economic and Agronomic Impacts of Agrivoltaics on Arable Land Use at the Example of the Stuttgart Region,en_US,"Photovoltaics and wind energy must be considerably expanded to achieve the targeted climate neutrality in Germany in 2045 which may cause new conflicts. Especially ground-mounted photovoltaic systems, which are often associated with a high land consumption rate, conflict with other land uses such as agriculture. Due to the simultaneous electricity generation and agricultural use, agrivoltaics (AV) systems can increase land use efficiency which is why they are in the political focus. In this study, we go beyond the limited point-wise analyses of previous studies which have focused mainly on the technology itself and potential yield changes of individual crops and provide a spatially explicit analysis of the AV potential. This is done by an in-depth analysis on the example of arable land in the Stuttgart Region, one of the most important conurbations in Germany and Europe. The study focusses on the resulting agronomic effects in the region and the associated agro-economic effects. The analysis is carried out with an integrated land use model that optimises arable land use by maximising gross margins at the farm level. Legal framework conditions such as the regional plan are considered constraints, and existing studies on yield effects under AV are used. The results show that there are synergies through increases in the agricultural gross margins. These synergies could be realized on about 3% of arable land in the study region subject to the underlying assumptions made. With more than 10% of the arable land in the study region used for AV, the average gross margins in arable farming decrease by about 280 € per ha of AV. Farms or areas with a high share of special crops, such as strawberries, demonstrate the highest profitability. On the other hand, regions with a high share of root crops in the crop rotation seem to be less favourable to establish AV. This demonstrates that, the agricultural land use structure must be considered in the holistic assessment of the land use efficiency of AV installations. Our results help policymakers better assess the effects of AV on land use and are useful for identifying priority implementation areas, for instance, in regional or land use plans.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0334,2023-05-11,72,2,2023,,Articles,ART,,2,Christian,Sponagel,Arndt,Feuerbacher,Daniela,Bendel,Tobias Karl David,Weber,Enno,Bahrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0334.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,Nitrogen Surplus Displays a Spurious Environmental Kuznets Curve in Germany,en_US,"We examine the relationship between nitrogen surplus per hectare and the median monthly wage per capita considering the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory. The EKC hypothesizes an inverse U-shape relationship between environmental pollution and per capita income. We use a novel panel data set for nitrogen surplus as an environmental pollutant and a measure of the median monthly wage per capita during the period from 1999 to 2018 for 401 counties in Germany. Our estimation results show that nitrogen surplus displays a spurious EKC in Germany. It is spurious because the inverse U-shape relationship of nitrogen surplus and median wage is rejected by almost all model specifications and by tracing of individual county paths. This implies that in Germany economic growth has not cleaned up the environmental damage from nitrogen surplus. The affected counties remain in a spatial cluster (shown with the individual county paths) that they cannot break out of in the course of the EKC, at least not without political intervention.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0241,2023-05-15,72,2,2023,,Articles,ART,,4,Bente,Castro Campos,Martin,Petrick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0241.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,The National and Regional Impact of the EU Bioeconomy  Strategies on the Agri-Food Sector: Insights from Germany,en_US,"The bioeconomy strategy of the European Union aims to balance three distinct goals: food security, the sustainable use of renewable resources for industrial purposes, and environmental protection.

This study uses an integrated computable general equilibrium model to simulate the impacts of selected elements of the EU bioeconomy strategy on German agriculture at national and regional level up to 2050. An improved productivity of the crop sector substantially increases production and export/import ratio of crop outputs and reduces crop prices, while only moderately expanding cropland.

The improved crop productivity would help to reduce the competition for resources between non-food and food biomass use as well as between crop and livestock production. An increasing conversion efficiency of agricultural biomass for use in biorefineries alone is unlikely to have a significant impact on the German bioeconomy.

Overall, the results suggest the need for further efforts to improve crop productivity and effective complementary measures supporting the development of transformative technologies and changes in consumer preferences to ensure a minimum level of biomass use in the chemical sector.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0274,2023-05-17,72,2,2023,,Articles,ART,,5,Yaghoob,Jafari,Linmei,Shang,Arnim,Kuhn,Thomas,Heckelei,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0274.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,"Public Agricultural Extension, Pest and Disease Experience, and Adoption of Improved Wheat Varieties",en_US,"Improved varieties are considered critical for increasing crop yields worldwide. This study explored the effects of public agricultural extension and pest and disease experience on adoption of improved varieties using survey data on 525 wheat farmers in Anhui Province, China, to which the Heckman sample selection model was applied. The results showed that public agricultural extension had a significant positive relationship with adoption of improved varieties. Demonstration and training, as different forms of agricultural extension, both increased the probability of farmers adopting improved varieties, but only demonstration had a marked effect on degree of adoption. Pest and disease experience increased the probability of adoption of improved varieties by farmers and significantly enhanced the effect of public agricultural extension, but did not affect degree of adoption. Further analysis using an endogenous switching regression model revealed that adoption of improved varieties raised wheat yields by around 337.83 kg/ha. Public agricultural extension should thus be strengthened, especially for farmers with pest and disease experience, and a diversified, well-functioning agricultural extension system should be provided.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0350,2023-08-23,72,3-4,2023,,Articles,ART,,2,Xin,Wang,Yanping,Song,Wei,Huang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0350.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,A Trans-Theoretical Model for Farmers’ perceived Usefulness of Digital Risk Management Tools – A Case Study from Germany,en_US,"Digital risk management tools (RMTs) are promising to help farmers manage risk. However, these recently developed tools are still unexplored and hardly used by farmers. This study is the first to investigate how German farmers perceive the usefulness of digital RMTs and which factors influence them. A novel modification of the trans-theoretical model was made to determine farmers’ perceived usefulness gradually. The regression results show that, on average, farmers perceive digital RMTs as potentially useful. Perceptions are positively influenced by a higher level of education, full-time employment on the farm, use of mobile devices and a higher perceived importance of digital tools. The study contributes to the literature by investigating the extent to which farmers are willing to accept the combination of digitisation and risk management. The results are of interest to policy makers involved in digital agriculture and to agricultural tool providers, as they offer first insights into farmers’ acceptance of digital RMTs. Researchers benefit from the successfully applied trans-theoretical model fitting.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0330,2023-10-23,72,3-4,2023,,Articles,ART,,3,Julia B.,Block,Marius,Michels,Oliver,Mußhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0330.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en

,The Effect of Maximum Residue Limits on Agri-Food Trade: Evidence from Chinese Exports to the EU,en_US,"There is debate about whether maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides act as a catalyst or barrier to trade. By constructing a trade model based on heterogeneous firm quality and productivity, we show that MRLs’ net effects on total export value, the number of exporting firms, and the average export value per firm depend on the interplay between the effect on import demand and that on variable and fixed compliance costs. We employ firm-level transaction data for agri-food products exported from China to the European Union (EU). We use heterogeneity indices that combine the number and level of MRLs to measure MRL stringency between China and the EU; a Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator with fixed effects is used for estimation. We find that stricter MRLs, whether imposed by China or the EU, promote China’s agri-food exports to the EU. However, such promotion effects are heterogeneous across agri-food-exporting firms. In China, updates to MRL standards improve agri-food-exporting firms’ ability to comply with stricter MRLs. Public investment and services help reduce compliance costs. Our findings provide new evidence that MRLs are not new non-tariff measures adopted to replace reduced import tariffs.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0328,2023-11-17,72,3-4,2023,,Articles,ART,,5,Dongpo,Jiang,Qi,Li,Xia,Li,Ruiqiang,Sun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0328.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
,Use Cases of the Integrated Administration and Control  System’s Plot-Level Data: Protocol and Pilot Analysis for a Systematic Mapping Review,en_US,"In recent years, land use data from the EU’s Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) have become increasingly available for research purposes. IACS data contain annual plot-level information on cultivation and location of the land farmed by agricultural beneficiaries, covering the majority of farmland in the EU. The data thus provide information on land use that is spatially and temporally highly disaggregated. Researchers from a broad range of disciplines already rely on IACS data for various applications and EU member states must make an anonymised, geospatially-referenced version of the data publicly available in the future. However, there is no complete and structured overview of the data’s use, their benefits and limitations that future research could rely on. This calls for conducting a systematic review of the applications of IACS plot-level data in scientific literature. Preparing the ground for such a review, this paper presents a review protocol for identifying and analysing publications using plot-level IACS data from Austria, Czechia, France, Germany, and Sweden in a systematic map. To test and refine the protocol and to illustrate the planned review, we conduct a pilot analysis of 12 selected academic publications and present the results. The pilot analysis demonstrates that the review protocol is adequate and that novel insights will be gained by mapping out the already existing work that uses IACS data.",,,,10.30430/gjae.2023.0385,2023-11-18,72,3-4,2023,,Articles,ART,,6,Heidi,Leonhardt,Silke,Hüttel,Tobia,Lakes,Maximilian,Wesemeyer,Saskia,Wolff,,,,,,,,,,,,,GJAE_0385.pdf,PDF,Article Text,en
